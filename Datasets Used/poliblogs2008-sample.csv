"1","After a week of false statements, lies, and dismissive apologies, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf now says that he is disatisfied with the probe into former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's death and is asking Scotland Yard for help:""One should not give a statement that's 100 percent final. That's the flaw that we suffer from,"" Musharraf said at a news conference, noting that more evidence was emerging about the attack. ""We needed more experience, maybe more forensic and technical experience that our people don't have. Therefore I thought Scotland Yard may be more helpful."" Musharraf said he also reached out to British investigators for assistance to dispel accusations that Pakistan's military or intelligence services were involved. ""We don't mind going to any extent, as nobody is involved from the government or agency side,"" he said. Speaking a week after Bhutto's assassination in a shooting and suicide bombing, Musharraf denied there had been a security lapse and implied that Bhutto, who was greeting supporters through the sunroof of her armored vehicle at the time of the attack, was partly responsible. ""Who is to be blamed for her coming out (of) her vehicle?"" he asked, adding that others in the vehicle had not been hurt in the attack.When in doubt, blame the victim.Reports in the immediate aftermath of the bombing said that as far back as November, Bhutto believed Musharraf was deliberately withholding security forces that could have made her safer. Unless he feared Bhutto more than the street riotors, I doubt whether that was really true. More likely, he didn't trust the army to protect her. And when she requested that Musharraf allow her to use western private security firms, he refused.I don't think Musharraf wanted Bhutto dead. But I think he is just too weak and indecisive to have done what was needed to protect her.","at0800300_1.text","Conservative",3,"at"
"2","I honestly don't know how either party's caucus results will play out tonight. Usually, you can get a good idea of perhaps not a winner but at least you can figure out who's up, who's down, and who's on life support.Not with the Iowa Caucuses. Races in both parties are just too close to call. So many variables. So much volatility among the voters. And the polls are whacky.As an example, here are the final two polls out on Iowa. First, ARG:Mike Huckabee 29% (23%) Mitt Romney 24% (32%) Fred Thompson 13% (7%) John McCain 11% (11%) Rudy Giuliani 8% (6%) Ron Paul 6% (6%) Duncan Hunter 4% (2%) Undecided 4% (11%) (Number in parentheses is from ARG survey taken last week)The spread between Huckabee and Romney is the margin of error which means they are virtually tied. Note Thompson's huge bump. Is he surging? Many think so although he probably doesn't have enough juice to catch either front runner for second place. But a strong third sends him along the campaign trail - despite what you might have heard about him dropping out. (Fred and his staff are denying the filthy rumor every chance they get.)Meanwhile, Zogby's daily tracking poll (three day rolling average) tells a little different story:* Huckabee - 31%* Romney - 25%* Thompson - 11%*McCain -10%Here the Huckster opens up a slight lead on Romney with Thompson and McCain far back in the pack.On the Democratic side, Obama has sprinted into the lead:Democrat Barack Obama continued his upward momentum through the evening before the Iowa caucuses, capturing the lead ahead of rivals John Edwards and Hillary Clinton.. Meanwhile, Republican Mike Hucakbee widened his lead over Mitt Romney down the stretch, the newest and last Reuters/C–SPAN/Zogby daily telephone tracking poll in Iowa shows. Obama broke through the 30% barrier for the first time, gaining 31% support after another strong day leading up to the caucuses. But more dramatic was Clinton’s four-point drop in this last day of tracking. Edwards moved into second place by himself after another day where he steadily gained ground. This fifth and final daily tracking poll was conducted using live telephone operators in the Zogby call center in Upstate New York. Edwards finished this Zogby daily tracking in Iowa in the same place as four years ago, when Zogby correctly identified the finishing order of the candidates in that caucus.Hillary Clinton has been playing down her chances the last 48 hours and could very well finish 3rd.All of this matters little in the end. The process of caucusing is complicated for the Democrats and it is possible for any of the top three candidates to win or come in third.We'll see by midnight tonight central time.","at0800300_2.text","Conservative",3,"at"
"3","While we stand in awe of the willingness of our troops in Iraq to sacrifice themselves for the Nation, the fewer that are required to do so, the better.  And the news on that front is good.  As can be seen in the chart below, our military deaths in December dropped to 23 from 37 in November.  December deaths are down over 80% (82%) from May's peak this year of 126.  Assuming this reflects a permanent change in the correlation of forces in Iraq - and it is likely that it does, although we cannot be certain of it - it reflects a tremendous achievement on the part of General Petraeus, since this is the result not of retreating from our objectives in Iraq but of advancing toward them - of executing the mission.What of Iraqi deaths?  Iraqi security forces and civilian fatalities are also down in December from November. Iraqi deaths are down only by a small amount - from 560 in November to 534 in December, although that difference is not small if you are one of the ones who are now still alive.  And the decline from this year's peak in February of 3,014 is a drop of 82%(!).Are we out of the woods in Iraq?  It would seem not.  We have General Odierno's estremely disturbing cri de coeur  at the end of November, which we can assume was endorsed by his chief, General Petraeus.  So far as we know, General Odierno's point ""A window of opportunity has opened for the government to reach out to its former foes, said Army Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the commander of day-to-day U.S. military operations in Iraq, but ‘it's unclear how long that window is going to be open.'""has not been resolved.  While some economic indicators, such as the Iraq Stock Exchange and the value of the Iraqi dinar, are showing real strength, the status of the estimated 4 million internal and external refugees remains open, as does the high unemployment rate, estimated at over 40%.  But the fatalities figures are good news on the war-fighting front and we don't want to miss them.  Success doesn't always announce itself.   It's important not to miss it when it is achieved.","at0800300_3.text","Conservative",3,"at"
"4","These pages recently said goodbye to global warming.  Ironically, the current spell of global warming, such as it is, can be expected to end just as the Kyoto treaty ends in 2012, but having nothing to do with reduced emissions from fossil fuels.  For the remainder of this century, it will be global cooling we'll have to worry about, according to highly credentialed Russian scientist, Dr. Oleg Sorokhtin.Dr. Sorokhtin, Merited Scientist of Russia and fellow of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, is staff researcher of the Oceanology Institute.  He explains the recent warming as a natural trend.""Earth is now at the peak of one of its passing warm spells. It started in the 17th century when there was no industrial influence on the climate to speak of and no such thing as the hothouse effect. The current warming is evidently a natural process and utterly independent of hothouse gases.""So what will happen in the future?""Astrophysics knows two solar activity cycles, of 11 and 200 years. Both are caused by changes in the radius and area of the irradiating solar surface. The latest data, obtained by Habibullah Abdusamatov, head of the Pulkovo Observatory space research laboratory, say that Earth has passed the peak of its warmer period, and a fairly cold spell will set in quite soon, by 2012. Real cold will come when solar activity reaches its minimum, by 2041, and will last for 50-60 years or even longer.""Physical and mathematical calculations predict a new Ice Age. It will come in 100,000 years, at the earliest, and will be much worse than the previous. Europe will be ice-bound, with glaciers reaching south of Moscow.""The high standing of Dr. Sorkhtin and the inherent plausibility of his argument that climate will continue to follow the same basic causal factor, solar activity, make this another heavy blow to the heavy breathing of the global warming alarmists, who insist there is no argument at all.","at0800300_4.text","Conservative",3,"at"
"5","A US report shows how the enemy controlled the information on the battlefield in Fallujah and used this to force the US and Iraqi forces out, in the first battle there. The Belmont Club points out UPI coverage of the report by Shaun Waterman. Here is how the enemy worked: First they kidnapped reporters from major Western news sources, driving them out of the city, and leaving only Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and local stringers controlled by the enemy as the sole sources of news. When the US returned with many embedded journalists and cut the enemy's information monopoly we won.These figures demonstrate how the insurgency purposely drove the press from the field to recreate the information monopoly they found so advantageous in the opening days of the First Fallujah, when only journalists from Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya were reporting from the scene. The kidnapping campaign compelled news outlets to rely on stringers who could then be controlled by the insurgency and who could be counted on to miraculously stumble on photo opportunities showing insurgents in action, such as the Pulitzer Prize winning photograph of an Iraqi election worker being killed on Haifa Street. The effective riposte again turned out to be finding ways to break the reportorial stranglehold the enemy had established. The information blockade runners turned out to be bloggers and journalists embedded in the military, of whom Michael Yon is perhaps the most famous. The Iraqi bloggers were protected by their anonymity and the embedded journalists were protected by coalition troops. These reporters outflanked the wall of ""access journalism"" which was gradually restricting the majors and created alternative sources of reportage. Although few in number these blockade runners played a pivotal role in penetrating the ""bodyguard of lies"" with which al-Qaeda and the Sunni insurgency had surrounded itself.","at0800300_5.text","Conservative",3,"at"
"6","Mike Huckabee is pretty slick. He's the one Republican who's been boosted by the big media. Those media headlines got him off to a fast start. But a couple of days ago he got the press laughing at his shenanigans with his ""I'm NOT negative!"" press conference. ""Mike Huckabee said Monday he wouldn't run a TV ad he'd prepared blistering Republican rival Mitt Romney as dishonest. Then he showed it to a room packed with reporters and cameramen.""  So Huckabee is talking to a giant media fest with dozens of TV cameras, surrounded by five anti-Mitt posters.  But he's very come-to-Jesus about it. You see, he's not actually going to run that negative ad on Mitt, because he's a good person. And just to show the press that he had the negative ad all ready to run, he'll tell them all the Mitt criticisms he's not going to put on TV. ""We have run it positive. We have gotten here by being positive.""   Even the reporters laughed it up.  So Huckabee tried to get his negative ad out for free, and still got to claim that he was being positive. Is that slick or what? It's like the guy whose wife tells him he sounds angry, and he screams at her, ""I'm NOT MAD!!"" A lot of people like Huckabee in person, but he looks like a basically angry man to me. At his pheasant hunting press show he ended up shooting his 20-gauge shotgun over the heads of the onlookers. That's just lousy firearms safety, as any hunter knows.  But Huck wasn't sorry. He said it was his way of telling Mitt Romney just ""don't get in my way."" The press asked him if he really meant to say that, and he just said it again. He did mean it. You just don't do that in a presidential primary. This isn't High Noon in Dodge City. Blasting your shotgun over the heads of the press looks like an impulsive action, by a man who allows his anger to take over his judgment. This is the same guy who's written a book called, ""Kids who kill: Confronting Our Culture of Violence.""  But he didn't set a good example by shooting off his shotgun over people's heads. Huck's not a conservative but a populist politician, like Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.  ""I'm out to change the Republican Party"" is his way of saying it. But then he calls himself a  conservative.  Huckabee isn't good on foreign policy, so he makes really basic mistakes. His advisors just say ""he wasn't briefed"" on things like Pakistan and the assassination of Bhutto. The trouble is that a president can't just brush up on this dangerous world when some headline story comes up. He's got to be ahead of the curve. A US president should know that Pakistan has been at the center of the war on terror since before 9/11/01, when  the Taliban  sheltered Osama Bin Laden. Pakistan's intelligence service set up the Taliban in the first place. Today it looks like the same AQ-Taliban goons killed Benazir Bhutto.  This can't be news to a presidential candidate. And that's only Pakistan: What about Russia, China, the Middle East? It's just not good enough. America can't settle for a politician who's not up to speed, and who violates firearms safety rules to send a political message. We can't afford a politician who plays the liberal media against the conservative base. Let's leave the slicksters to the Democrats. We have better candidates.

"7","In the aftermath of the ""upset"" victories in yesterday's Iowa caucus by Republican Mike Huckabee and Democrat Barack Obama, both the mainstream media and the political commentariat are in a lather over what these results portend for the 2008 presidential race.   The answer:  Very little.The history of the Iowa caucus shows that it is a poor predictor of who the eventual presidential nominees will be, let alone who will win the general election.  For example:In 1972, the eventual Democratic nominee George McGovern came in second to Edmund Muskie.In 1976, the eventual Democratic nominee, and winner of the general election, Jimmy Carter came in second to an ""uncommitted"" slate of delegates.In 1980, George H.W. Bush bested Ronald Reagan in the Republican caucus.In 1988, both George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominees of their respective parties, came in third.In 1992, Democrat Tom Harkin won his party's caucus.Indeed, the only non-incumbent to win his party's caucus and then go on to win the general election was George W. Bush in 2000.Moreover, we should not forget that Iowa is far from representative of the nation as a whole, either in terms of demographics or economics.  So the fact that a particular candidate appeals to a plurality of his party's voters in Iowa does not tell us how well he or she will do in other state primaries.  In short, the fact that Huckabee and Obama earned first place honors in this year's Iowa caucus tells us nothing about their respective candidacies that we didn't already know, to wit, that they are serious candidates for their party's nomination.That being said, I believe the ""message"" out of Iowa is very different for the Democratic and Republican front-runners.For the Democrats, Obama's victory, and John Edwards' second-place finish, clearly indicates that Hillary Clinton's nomination is not inevitable and that she has much to worry about heading into New Hampshire and Super Tuesday.  A few weeks ago I offered my thoughts on how an Obama nomination very likely will lead to a Republican victory in 2008.  Go Obama!  http://www.americanthinker.com/2007/12/hillarys_stumble_could_be_grea.html  For the Republicans, I think Huckabee's strong win indicates that the race for the nomination remains wide-open, and that none of the party's presumptive leaders - Giuliani, Romney, McCain, and Thompson - has established himself as the candidate to beat.  I remain convinced that one of these four candidates, not Huckabee, will win the Republican nomination.  Probably Giuliani or Romney, whom I consider to be the top two Republican candidates.  For Giuliani supporters, among whom I count myself, Romney's failure to win in Iowa augers well for their candidate.  Giuliani's strategy to ignore Iowa may have been fatal had Romney won in Iowa and then won in New Hampshire (boosted by his Iowa win).  Now it appears that the ""hype"" coming out of Iowa will be about Huckabee, and that, without a boost for Romney, McCain may win in New Hampshire.  This means that going into Super Tuesday, there still won't be a clear front-runner among the Republicans, and both Giuliani and Romney will have an opportunity to make their presidential fortunes on February 5.Steven M.

"8","FrontPage.Com has an editorial up this morning pointing out the deficiencies of both of the Iowa winners last night; Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee:Last night, Iowa caucus-goers had the opportunity to vote for a wide variety of candidates who possessed foreign policy sagacity, an aggressive plan to fight sponsors of terrorism, and the competence and breadth of experience to lead the nation during the War on Terror – and the plurality of neither party chose to do so. Instead, they selected affable and charismatic figures who appeal to portions of the party’s base but who lack credibility on national security – an unsettling reality in a post-9/11 world. [snip] Today, he’s running to become commander-in-chief of the forces fighting that ""dumb war,"" a description certain to erode morale. While always careful to note the troops’ courage and valor, he also talks down their grand accomplishments at defeating al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia. On his website currently, Obama writes during the present surge, ""our troops have helped reduce violence in some areas of Iraq, but even those reductions do not get us below the unsustainable levels of violence of mid-2006."" This is both disspiriting and false. The New York Times reported late last month that ""violent attacks in the country had fallen by 60 percent since June."" Rather than the surge, which has driven al-Qaeda out of Anbar Province, Obama would have removed all U.S. troops by this March. The Obama Plan offers ""at least $2 billion to expand services to Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries."" But thanks to the Bush surge, in October alone, 110,000 refugees returned to the newly pacified Iraq. Nor has our present military success taught him anything. He now pledges to ""have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months."" Who will take America’s place in newly destabilized Baghdad? Phantom troops and bearded mullahs.It is frightening to consider the idea that a man who thinks his living abroad as a child gives him suitable foreign policy experience to be president is now the front runner for the Democratic nomination. And Republicans didn't do any better in choosing a candidate last night: Huckabee believes Bush has been far too demanding. ""Instead of asking if someone is for us, instead of demanding that every ally be at the level of Great Britain, I will ask if we should be for them, if they can be useful in any way, however limited, however temporary.""But that was exactly the plea President Bush made when he uttered that phrase. Huckabee demonstrates exactly how he is willing to go slumming for support, noting in his Iraq policy, ""I support a regional summit so that Iraq's neighbors become militarily and financially committed to stabilizing Iraq."" Iraq’s ""neighbors"" include Iran and Syria. His feckless goodwill extends to Western Hemisphere dictators, as well. In 2002, the then-Arkansas governor signed a letter asking President Bush to lift the embargo against Castro’s Cuba. After receiving Cuban-American support in Florida, presidential candidate Huckabee reversed himself. What changed? Huckabee’s reply betrayed an impolitic sense of opportunism: ""Well, what changed was I’m running for president."" One, a dangerously naive neophyte the other a feckless dunce. Let's hope both parties can do better down the road.","at0800400_1.text","Conservative",4,"at"
"9","An influential policy outfit, the International Crisis Group, has called on President Musharraf to step down.Citing ""A Way Forward in Pakistan,"" the ICG, which is made up of scholars and former diplomats, believes that the Pakistani president is an obstacle to stability:If Pakistan is to be stable in the wake of Benazir Bhutto’s murder, President Pervez Musharraf must resign and a quick transition follow to a democratically elected civilian government. After Bhutto’s Murder: A Way Forward for Pakistan*, the latest briefing from the International Crisis Group, concludes that Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup, is no longer, if he ever was, a factor for stability. Particularly the U.S. must recognise he is a serious liability, seen as complicit in the death of the popular politician. Unless he steps down, tensions will worsen and the international community could face the nightmare of a nuclear-armed, Muslim country descending into civil war from which extremists would stand to gain. “Bhutto’s death has drawn the battle lines even more clearly between Musharraf’s military-backed regime and Pakistan’s moderate majority, which will settle for nothing less than genuine parliamentary democracy”, says Mark Schneider, Crisis Group's Senior Vice-President. These foreign policy bluebloods don't explain how exactly Pakistan gets from Point A (Musharraf) to Point B (a ""quick transition"" to democratic government). There's the little matter of the Pakistani military not to mention an intelligence service hostile to democracy itself. Short of an invasion by a foreign power to force the issue of an election held in a vacuum of power, it's very difficult to see how Pakistan achieves ""a quick transition"" to anything except chaos. Musharraf is not a creation of the Bush Administration. He came to power in 1999 for reasons having nothing to do with America and everything to do with the internal dynamics of Pakistani politics and the long time uneasy relationship between the civilian government and the military. His agenda is not Washington's or the International Community's agenda. This has made him an enormously troubling and difficult ally in the War on Terror. But an ally he is. And to consider throwing Musharraf off the bus at this point is pretty close to madness. It is he that is standing between the extremists and Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. And as unreliable as he might be, Musharraf is still someone who can get the process rolling toward democracy.","at0800400_2.text","Conservative",4,"at"
"10","Goodbye Iowa for 4 more years. But the Hawkeye State may have crowned the new President this time: Barack Obama. I believe he will be very hard to stop now, both for the nomination and the general election if he is nominated, given how shattered the GOP is (that race is wide open, with a slight edge to John McCain). This is, in my opinion, very bad news for American national security and for Israel. Our enemies will not disappear because a new President wants to concentrate on stem cell research or global warming or universal health care. Obama is a candidate from the pacifist left side of the Democratic Party with little knowledge of the Middle East (he has spent most of his time in the Senate running for President) and in my opinion, his positions are wrong or naive. Obama believes we can talk to Iran, and Hamas, and maybe even Al Qaeda, and work with them, if we are more open to their concerns and less aggressive and bullying. And of course we must get out of Iraq quickly (leaving the place for Iran and Al Qaeda to divvy up).  No, there are real bad guys in that part of the world, and they want to kill us, dominate us, obliterate Israel and eventually destroy our western civilization. There is a global jihad, but thinking about it makes many people uncomfortable. Obama is running as the political messiah, rising above pettiness, and the old politics But I fear the emperor has no clothes. Given the turnout in the Democratic race, almost double the GOP turnout, the passion and excitement appears to be all on one side. Mike Huckabee has been run down by the GOP establishment and many pundits. I have not joined in that slaughter effort to date. While I think he would be a terrible GOP candidate in a general election, he is tapping into something real as well -- a general uneasiness   among many American about their economic future.  Obama and Edwards, with his Naderite hateful rhetoric about corporations, also addressed this. But none of them have real answers to complex problems of energy supply and pricing, trade imbalances, the weak dollar, health care spending and program costs, the rise of China, the power of sovereign wealth funds, and how to spur the economy (taxing the rich more heavily, or shifting the tax burden from the middle class to wealthier Americans will not create economic growth or cut budget or trade deficits.Richard Baehr is political director of American Thinker.","at0800400_3.text","Conservative",4,"at"
"11","Based on the last week of coverage, culminating in hours of talk about the Iowa caucuses last night, one might think that much was decided in the contest.  Much was also made of the record turnout.  But I feel that making too much of this contest is harmful to the process of electing the next president.  With that in mind, here's some raw numbers and a little math in public.CNN reports that 227,000 people caucused on the Democrat side and 120,000 people caucused on the Republican side.  There are roughly 3 million people in the state of Iowa and 301 million in the US.  Those numbers probably aren't exactly accurate, but they work for the purposes here.  The question is just how much stock to put in the electoral decisions of 347,000 people.  The media would have us believe that the decisions of this small group are of paramount importance, that much hangs in the balance.But that group - 347,000 - is only 1.157% of the population of Iowa and 0.1153% of the population of the US.Undue influence on the political process by such a small segment of the population, it seems, fueled by media desire for an actual, tangible story not created by the candidates or their operatives in this seemingly endless presidential race.  Humbug.Bob Myer blogs at http://www.mindofflapjack.blogspot.com/","at0800400_4.text","Conservative",4,"at"
"12","Historian Richard Brookhiser puts is succinctly at NRO's The Corner this morning:But a man who could not have used certain restrooms forty years ago is in the center ring, not as a freak in the manner of Alberto Fujimori or Sonia Gandhi, nor even as a faction fighter in the style of Jesse Jackson, but as a real player. One of our great national sins is being obliterated, as the years pass, by the virtues of our national system. I don't agree with Obama and I don't particularly like him, but I am proud of this moment. Those of us of a certain age may be surprised that an even bigger deal isn't being made out of the fact that an African American just won a huge victory in a state that is 96% white. Other pundits are marveling at the Obama phenomenon with equal surprise: David Brooks: Barack Obama has won the Iowa caucuses. You’d have to have a heart of stone not to feel moved by this. An African-American man wins a closely fought campaign in a pivotal state. He beats two strong opponents, including the mighty Clinton machine. He does it in a system that favors rural voters. He does it by getting young voters to come out to the caucuses. This is a huge moment. It’s one of those times when a movement that seemed ethereal and idealistic became a reality and took on political substance. Iowa won’t settle the race, but the rest of the primary season is going to be colored by the glow of this result. Whatever their political affiliations, Americans are going to feel good about the Obama victory, which is a story of youth, possibility and unity through diversity — the primordial themes of the American experience. Peggy Noonan: As for Sen. Obama, his victory is similarly huge. He won the five biggest counties in Iowa, from the center of the state to the South Dakota border. He carried the young in a tidal wave. He outpolled Mrs. Clinton among women. He did it with a classy campaign, an unruffled manner, and an appeal on the stump that said every day, through the lines: Look at who I am and see me, the change that you desire is right here, move on with me and we will bring it forward together.Andrew Sullivan: Look at their names: Huckabee and Obama. Both came from nowhere - from Arkansas and Hawaii. Both campaigned as human beings, not programmed campaign robots with messages honed in focus groups. Both faced powerful and monied establishments in both parties. And both are running two variants on the same message: change, uniting America again, saying goodbye to the bitterness of the polarized past, representing ordinary voters against the professionals. Neither has been ground down by long experience, but neither is a neophyte. You have a Republican educated in a Bible college; and a Democrat who is the most credible African-American candidate for the presidency in history. Their respective margins were far larger than most expected. And the hope they have unleashed is palpable. E.J. Dionne: Change, particularly generational change, was also at the heart of Barack Obama's victory over Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Edwards. Young voters and independents flocked to the Illinois senator. Media entrance polls showed that Obama defeated Clinton by better than 5 to 1 among voters under age 30, and such voters made up almost as large a share of the caucus electorate as voters over 65, a strongly pro-Clinton group. Among independents, Obama beat Clinton by better than 2 to 1. Matthew Yglesias: I think the manner of Barack Obama's win is pretty impressive. I can't be the only one who was a bit inclined toward a cynical roll of the eyes at the idea of winning on the back of unprecedented turnout, mobilizing new voters, brining in young people, etc. That sounds like the kind of thing that people say they're going to do but never deliver on. But he did deliver. That's impressive. Perhaps the best line written about last night's Obama win is a touch more negative. From Powerline: CONCLUDING THOUGHTS: Iowa has given its seal of approval to (1) a one-term Senator who stands for ""hope"" and ""change"" and (2) a tacky, big spending governor who doesn't know much about foreign policy but did stay at a Holiday Inn Express. The common demoninator here, other than a patent lack of qualifications for the presidency, is likeability. Well done, (small fraction of) Iowa.","at0800400_5.text","Conservative",4,"at"
"13","I am one of those Iowa caucus skeptics, regarding it as a media-driven show. But even I can see that the momentum generated last night for Obama extends beyond mere media event dimensions.Even worse, the obvious enthusiasm on the Democrat side contrasts with the bitter divisions among the GOP field and base. I have warned against the dangers of counting out Hillary, so I don't think that the race is over. But her inevitability is now shattered into small pieces. The size of Obama's turnout and the level of enthusiasm for him among younger voters both spell huge trouble for not just Hillary, but the Republican Party. Adding a raft of new first time young voters to the Democratic totals in the election, something it appears Obama may be capable of accomplishing, could lead to a blowout election triumph for the party of the left.Obama is leading a crusade, one whose nebulous but important goals include a vital racial healing subtext, is almost poisonous to oppose. David Brooks this morning wrote: Americans are not going to want to see this stopped. When an African-American man is leading a juggernaut to the White House, do you want to be the one to stand up and say No?There is indeed a degree of don't rain-on-the-parade animus among a large majority of the country which wants to embrace and sing kumbaya, when it comes to giving every consideration to a nice-looking, well-educated, hard-working, personally responsible family man who happens to be black. When his entire appeal is based on uniting us, attacking him just seems like being mean, and an awful lot of young people who have never voted before think that ""mean people suck."" This is very scary, because Obama is untested and obviously unprepared to lead America through the perilous geopolitical challenges we face.Obama's views, life experiences, and detailed plans must be scrutinized very carefully, and Americans must think seriously about the challenges we face. But that is awfully hard to do if the country embraces the romantic and rather vacuous platitudes offered by the first African-American front-runner for a major party nomination.It isn't always rewarding to be the party of the grown-ups.","at0800400_6.text","Conservative",4,"at"
"14","*Over Guiliani, anyway.Actually Paul did quite well in the Iowa Caucuses last night. The 10% of voters who believe in Paul's pastiche of libertarian dogma and paleoconservative theology turned out and gave Paul a 5th place showing.What does it mean for the GOP?To give Paul his due, even in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 -- when the emotional response to the assault was at its rawest -- serious scholars had begun hashing over the role played by American policy in the Mideast, particularly long-standing support for Israel, in fueling Islamic extremism and hatred for the U.S. But in the format of a candidate debate -- where rhetorical zingers count far more than lengthy discourse -- Paul's remark amounted to a grooved fast ball down the middle, and the consensus at the time was that Giuliani parked it. As MSNBC's online political note put it at the time, Giuliani may want to ""hire out Paul for the campaign trail -- he could be the Washington Generals to Rudy's Globetrotters"" (i.e., the patsy willing to get beaten in every game). That was then, this is now. In Iowa, Paul, 10%; Giuliani, 4%.Since Rudy made no effort at all in Iowa, I'm not sure exactly what kind of ""victory"" Mr. Paul can take away from the contest. One thing, however, is absolutely sure; all the complaints by the Paulbots that the pollsters were in cahoots with ""The Man"" to destroy Paul's candidacy have now been proven to be the idiotic rantings of paranoids that every sane person was saying they were. Paul does not have some huge resevoir of support in the GOP nor anywhere else for that matter. He has a lot of money - partially raised through neo Nazi and Kluxer websites - and not much else. Maybe after a similar dismal showing in New Hampshire, Ron Paul will read the writing on the wall and go back to Texas. Whether he can recapture a well deserved obscurity is another matter entirely.","at0800400_7.text","Conservative",4,"at"
"15","First, if you haven't already done so, read American Thinker's Political Director Richard Baehr's piece ""The Big Winners"" which not only gives an outstanding analysis of last night's results but lays out the various scenarios for upcoming primaries where the front runners will fight it out.But even Richard doesn't mention the Wyoming Caucuses taking place this Saturday. He's not alone. The national media has completely ignored this GOP conclave that has the potential to alter the race ever so slightly before Tuesday's New Hampshire contest.Jim Geraghty at NRO's The Campaign Spot links to this piece in the Billings Gazette that describes the stakes:Ron Paul, Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson spent $10,000 each to acquire a list of the names and contact information for party members who will help select the national delegates. Romney set up a state office in Casper, Cubin said. There have also been calls on behalf of candidates from national GOP figures - including Mary Matalin, a former counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney, who is supporting Thompson, the former U.S. senator from Tennessee. ""The response has been terrific,"" Matalin said by telephone Thursday, noting that state GOP members have been keenly interested in Thompson's stance on important national issues. ""The thing about Wyoming people, they just like the straight talk. I'm not spinning anybody and not offering any pointers.""Might the Wyoming GOP give either Thompson or Romney a bit of a boost going into New Hampshire and beyond? A win in Wyoming for Romney would be big. Coming on the heels of the Iowa disappointment, it would show wavering New Hampshire voters that he has appeal in a conservative state and that the race is still wide open. And if Fred Thompson can find some way to prevail, there is the shock value of a candidate most people have given up on getting a win. Jim Geraghty: Who wins is anybody's guess, as no polls have been conducted or released. The Billings Gazette notes, ""some Republican committee members say a couple of candidates - Romney and Thompson - may be rising to the top."" Ron Paul has been buying newspaper ads in the state.It should be interesting to watch as developments unfold in this almost forgotten contest.","at0800400_8.text","Conservative",4,"at"
"16","The incomparable Noemie Emery reviews Sally Bedell Smith's book on the Clinton's in this week's Weekly Standard:With their rigor and discipline went a lack of intuition and nuance--the je ne sais quoi that makes a political talent, and that no amount of effort and diligence can ever supply. Bill loved campaigning; Gore found it a struggle, and his torment was obvious. Hillary is an unhappy warrior--at best, a grim one--and her description of the anticipated evisceration of Barack Obama as the ""fun"" part was a chilling moment that surprised no one who has looked into For Love of Politics. Unlike Bill, Gore and Hillary have no sense of how they appear to others, and seldom fail to make the wrong gesture--Hillary's cackle, the grating ""caw"" she unleashes in efforts at levity, is on a par with the sighs, eye-rolling, and other strange efforts at intimidation that helped Gore lose the election in the 2000 debates. With their conspicuous lack of political talents, neither Gore nor Hillary would ever have reached the top tier of candidates if they had not been elevated by being chosen by Clinton. But if they had been more graceful, and less pedantic and heavy-handed, they would not have been chosen, as they would not have supplied what Bill lacked. It was a bargain that worked well for Bill, but ended in heartbreak for Gore, and may do the same thing for Hillary Clinton. This story is not over yet.","at0800500_0.text","Conservative",5,"at"
"17","Although we have been very critical of the New York Times over its journalistic and business failings, there have been interesting signs of change there lately. The paper announced that Bill Kristol will write one column per week on its op-ed page. And yesterday there was a sensible op-ed  by William Dalrymple on the decidedly mixed legacy of Benazir Bhutto.It is hard to know if there is a move back toward the center-left for the paper, but if there is one, it might well be in recognition of the looming crisis the paper faces as Rupert Murdoch begins fashioning the Wall Street Journal into a general interest daily capable of drawing more readers and advertisers away from the Times' national edition. American Thinker will soon be publishing a major article by Ed Lasky on the Times-Journal strategic face-off, which promises to a major event in media history.But in the meantime, having cultivated a left wing readership, the Times is finding resistance in its efforts to move in from the left margin of politics. Jane Smiley, novelist and occasional writer for the Times, pens a bitter farewell to the paper. It seems that William Kristol is just too much for her to tolerate. This is a full-blown case of BDS rage, and it isn't very pretty:If you think that the Iraq War is a crime, as I do, it is bad enough that he was one of the primary cheerleaders for it, even after every single one of the reasons that the Cheney/Bush/right wing gave for the attack was exposed. But he is worse than that. Until the NIE report, he was actively advocating bombing Iran, preferably with nuclear weapons, even though the civilians in Iran who would be bombed have nothing at all to do with whatever the Iranian government is doing, or as it turns out, not doing to develop nuclear weapons. In Iraq alone, Kristol has the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hands. He is unrepentant and eager for more. [....]Why would the Times hire such a person? Stockholm Syndrome?

"18","In a unique format, ABC will host two debates tonight starting at 7:00 PM EDT with the Republicans taking the stage at St. Anselm College first followed immediately by the Democrats 90 minutes later:The network set rules to narrow the field. Candidates had to meet at least one of three criteria: place first through fourth in Iowa, poll 5 percent or higher in one of the last four major New Hampshire surveys, or poll 5 percent or higher in one of the last four major national surveys. Democrats Joe Biden and Chris Dodd took some of the pressure off ABC by quitting the race Thursday night. ""In previous debates where the stage was more crowded you had to make sure all of the candidates got fair time,"" said David Chalian, ABC News political director. ""Here you will have more time to go in depth on the issues."" ABC said it believed its rules were inclusive, while also ensuring viewers get a thorough look at the probable next president. ""We're regretful that we're not going to be in it,"" said Roy Tyler, a spokesman for Hunter. ""We're just going to keep working. I think it's a mistake on their part to exclude any viable candidate at this point."" The controversy over leaving out some of the candidates went to the FEC when Dennis Kucinich filed a complaint against ABC for excluding him: Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich filed a complaint with the FCC on Friday after ABC News excluded him, fellow Democrat Mike Gravel and Republican Duncan Hunter from its prime-time debates on Saturday. Kucinich argued that ABC is violating equal-time provisions by keeping him out of the debate and noted that ABC's parent Walt Disney Co. had contributed to campaigns involving the four Democrats who were invited. ""ABC should not be the first primary,"" the Ohio congressman said in papers filed at the Federal Communications Commission.

And with Obama's inexperience, I think it is likely he will make some kind of gaffe between now and Super Tuesday on February 5 which Hillary and her battle tested organization will try to take advantage. And no one knows how going negative on Obama will play. It could very well damage him if Hillary can expose Obama as the neophyte he is - especially on foreign policy.

They enmesh you in a grander moment, as if history has stopped flowing passively by, and, just for an instant, contracted around you, made you aware of its presence, and your role in it. He is not the Word made flesh, but the triumph of word over flesh, over color, over despair. The other great leaders I've heard guide us towards a better politics, but Obama is, at his best, able to call us back to our highest selves, to the place where America exists as a glittering ideal, and where we, its honored inhabitants, seem capable of achieving it, and thus of sharing in its meaning and transcendence.Just who are we electing here, a President or God Almighty? ""The word over flesh?"" Methinks Ezra Klien, the author of this panegyric, needs to take a cold shower or something. His piece is beyond devotional and enters the realm of worshipful. Klien is not alone. The media has gone gaga over Obama. The astonishingly reverent coverage of his events presages even more rock star images if he were to win New Hampshire. Hillary Clinton may be about to be steamrolled not by a candidate but by a man on a white horse. This substanceless, platitude-spouting lightweight with no foreign policy experience (""My grandmother grew up in a mud hut"") is being annointed as a combination re-incarnation of Robert Kennedy and Joan d'Arc.

"21","The blogosphere lost one of its finest on Thursday when Major Andrew Olmsted was killed in action in Iraq.Olmsted was a great writer who blogged at several sites including his own. His writing was penetrating, incisive, funny, tragic, and heartfelt. He had friends all over the internet who loved him and will miss his presence terribly.Prior to his posting to Iraq, Olmsted wrote the most remarkable post of his career and gave it to one of his co-bloggers at Obsidian Wings. His stipulation: That it only be published in the event of his death.Here, from beyond this life, are the words of wisdom from a man who dispensed little else in his blogging career:This is an entry I would have preferred not to have published, but there are limits to what we can control in life, and apparently I have passed one of those limits. And so, like G'Kar, I must say here what I would much prefer to say in person. I want to thank hilzoy for putting it up for me. It's not easy asking anyone to do something for you in the event of your death, and it is a testament to her quality that she didn't hesitate to accept the charge. As with many bloggers, I have a disgustingly large ego, and so I just couldn't bear the thought of not being able to have the last word if the need arose. Perhaps I take that further than most, I don't know. I hope so. It's frightening to think there are many people as neurotic as I am in the world. In any case, since I won't get another chance to say what I think, I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity. Such as it is. What I don't want this to be is a chance for me, or anyone else, to be maudlin. I'm dead. That sucks, at least for me and my family and friends. But all the tears in the world aren't going to bring me back, so I would prefer that people remember the good things about me rather than mourning my loss. (If it turns out a specific number of tears will, in fact, bring me back to life, then by all means, break out the onions.)And this entry, pleading with people not to make his death a political football: suppose I should speak to the circumstances of my death. It would be nice to believe that I died leading men in battle, preferably saving their lives at the cost of my own. More likely I was caught by a marksman or an IED. But if there is an afterlife, I'm telling anyone who asks that I went down surrounded by hundreds of insurgents defending a village composed solely of innocent women and children. It'll be our little secret, ok? I do ask (not that I'm in a position to enforce this) that no one try to use my death to further their political purposes. I went to Iraq and did what I did for my reasons, not yours. My life isn't a chit to be used to bludgeon people to silence on either side. If you think the U.S. should stay in Iraq, don't drag me into it by claiming that somehow my death demands us staying in Iraq. If you think the U.S. ought to get out tomorrow, don't cite my name as an example of someone's life who was wasted by our mission in Iraq. I have my own opinions about what we should do about Iraq, but since I'm not around to expound on them I'd prefer others not try and use me as some kind of moral capital to support a position I probably didn't support. Further, this is tough enough on my family without their having to see my picture being used in some rally or my name being cited for some political purpose. You can fight political battles without hurting my family, and I'd prefer that you did so. On a similar note, while you're free to think whatever you like about my life and death, if you think I wasted my life, I'll tell you you're wrong. We're all going to die of something. I died doing a job I loved. When your time comes, I hope you are as fortunate as I was.Read the whole thing - if you can.

"22","We took a trip to the National Gallery of Art in the lull between Christmas and New Years to see the Edward Hopper exhibit which continues until January 21. If you are in or near Washington before it closes, it would be worth your while to stop in and see it.   As is usual, the most famous of his paintings is in a gallery at the far end of the show which takes up several rooms, and there is a tendency, especially if there is a large crowd, to rush through the first rooms to get there; but if you do that, you will miss a treat. For his iconic paintings, known for their evocative effect, do not, I think, capture the full range of his artistic genius.   His earlier etchings and water colors do, however. To me, a painter must master light, and in these early paintings and sketches Hopper does indeed master it. Light and how it is absorbed and reflected on water, grain, roof tops, streets, and buildings are what makes his paintings of Glouster and Maine and Truoro so exceptional. The interplay between color, form and light has never been better illustrated.   After you've studied his early works and made it to the paintings for which he is most famous, you may notice what you'd overlooked in fascination with the scenarios represented: The gleam of reflected light off the coffee urns in Nighthawks, The different glow cast by different light sources in New York movie and Silber's Pharmacy, for example.   And, of course, it is a nostalgic view of middle class urban life we are seeing, because it is virtually non-existent in Manhattan where so much of this work was done.   Don't waste a lot of time reading what the museum has offered as explanations for some of these works. Hopper when asked usually replied there was no story; the painting just was what it was. "" Great art,"" he wrote,"" is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world."" And I think he was being truthful. He was an artist, not a storyteller. Though if I taught creative writing, I'd have the class members write their versions. Like most good artists, Hopper has left it to the viewer's internal perspective to fill in the tale he depicted. Fill in the blanks with your personal vision.","at0800500_6.text","Conservative",5,"at"
"23","In the midst of all the media gushing over Obama's Iowa upset Thursday night, allusions to Bobby Kennedy's 1968 ""united country"" campaign were bound to resurface. But a front page piece at HuffPo Friday suggested another possible similarity -- that the first black man ever to reach such political heights in this country might also find his presidential crusade cut short by an assassin's bullet..  What's more, it warns, the rifle projecting that bullet might belong to an outfit headed by a ""right-wing Christian nationalist.""Jospeph Polermo begins Barack Obama, RFK, and Blackwater optimistically enough by comparing Thursday's Obama victory speech to one given by Kennedy at the University of Alabama almost 40 years ago.  The heart just can't help warming while reading his assertion that Obama shares the vision of the man who was assassinated before realizing his promises to unify the nation and end both the war abroad and poverty at home.  But hope quickly fades as the blogger appears to suddenly consider the chemistry of his audience, and warns Obama and his handlers that the potential candidate would pose:""a very real threat to the likes of Blackwater, Dyncorps, Halliburton, and the hundreds of other private companies currently profiteering from the Iraq occupation.""He then suggests that private security company Blackwater Worldwide has a vested interest in the perpetuation of the Iraq war, which an Obama presidency would ""apply the brakes"" to, adding that:""He therefore has some well-armed and lethally trained enemies that stand to lose their livelihoods if he follows through on his promise to end the Iraq occupation.""The delightfully corporate-paranoid piece then sets up its conclusion with this thoroughly unsubstantiated lamentation:""When the political winds blow toward radical change our recent history shows that there's a tendency for popular leaders on the left to face some form of unexplained tragedy."" [emphasis mine]Strangely enough, other than Kennedy's assassination of 4 decades ago, the lone ""tragedy"" Palermo had mentioned was the Islamofascists' cowardly suicide-murder of Benazir Bhutto ""who didn't live to see election day.""  And, even were her tragic death somehow analogous, surely once in 40 years does hardly a ""tendency"" make.  Now, let's be clear -- I'm not suggesting that the man who would be America's first president of color has no natural mortal enemies.  He likely does. In fact, Obama is currently one of only two would-be candidates enjoying secret service protection this early in the campaign game.  While Hillary's bushy tail is provided courtesy of her eight year stint as first lady, Barak's apparently stems from thus far unspecified threats to his life, assumedly racist in nature. And speaking of the immeasurably ambitious junior senator from New York, long before President Obama might pose a threat to the political machinery of the right, potential candidate Obama already poses such to one of its most powerful and power-thirsty counterparts on the left.  After all, with what tricks might the Clinton machine hope to hamper the momentum of this man who now holds Iowa under his belt?  Inevitability -- gone. Experience -- questionably argued from the start and apparently of no value at the finish.  Attack Ads -- are more likely to spark a ricochet consequence by reinforcing Hill's already vicious image to a party obviously seeking peace than to impede the stampede.And yet, while it appears perfectly acceptable to suggest that agents of Blackwater might murder a presidential candidate, just imagine the outcry from the mainstream media were anyone to suggest that agents of a Whitewater principal might do the same.","at0800500_7.text","Conservative",5,"at"
"24","There is no more dangerous situation in the world today than what is happening in Pakistan. The incendiary combination of radical Islamists, unstable government, and nuclear weapons presents the greatest challenge to US security seen in many years.But this tense, volatile, potentially catastrophic situation only means business as usual for the New York Times and the cabal of leakers in the CIA who, unelected though they are, still arrogantly assume that they can dictate policy to the White House by leaking the most sensitive and secret plans of our government:President Bush’s senior national security advisers are debating whether to expand the authority of the Central Intelligence Agency and the military to conduct far more aggressive covert operations in the tribal areas of Pakistan. The debate is a response to intelligence reports that Al Qaeda and the Taliban are intensifying efforts there to destabilize the Pakistani government, several senior administration officials said. Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a number of President Bush’s top national security advisers met Friday at the White House to discuss the proposal, which is part of a broad reassessment of American strategy after the assassination 10 days ago of the Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. There was also talk of how to handle the period from now to the Feb. 18 elections, and the aftermath of those elections. Several of the participants in the meeting argued that the threat to the government of President Pervez Musharraf was now so grave that both Mr. Musharraf and Pakistan’s new military leadership were likely to give the United States more latitude, officials said. But no decisions were made, said the officials, who declined to speak for attribution because of the highly delicate nature of the discussions. ""The highly delicate nature of the discussions"" may be the understatement of the year. With rioters already in the streets of Pakistan and Musharraf barely able to keep the lid on, the prospect of the CIA or US Special Forces operating on Pakistani territory - even if it is only under discussion - has the potential to bring about an explosion of anti-American violence in the streets directed against Musharraf.This is something all the critics of American timidity in attacking Taliban and al-Qaeda sanctuaries in the tribal areas of Pakistan have never understood. Musharraf has been adamant that no US forces operate on Pakistani territory because he well knows that the radicals would be easily be able to stir up a hornets nest of anti-American sentiment in the streets. This would destablize the government even more. And if this were to come to pass, it would be a direct result from unnecessary leaks from the faction at the CIA opposed to any aggressive move by America to protect itself or its interests and their willing partners at the New York Times who never met a secret they didn't want to spill.","at0800600_0.text","Conservative",6,"at"
"25","Just as Edwards and Obama ganged up on Hillary Clinton in their debate on ABC last night, so too did GOP rivals of candidate Mitt Romney in their portion of the evening's proceedings.And they did it for the same reason; to deal a fatal blow to their rival's chances for ultimate victory. Politico's Jonathon Martin (who is responsible for spreading a false rumor on the eve of the Iowa Caucuses given him by the Romney campaign that Fred Thompson was going to drop out of the race) also highlights the personal animus most of the GOP candidates hold for Romney:For months, there has been an open secret among insiders working in or covering the 2008 Republican campaign: The rival candidates despise Mitt Romney. After Saturday night in New Hampshire, it's no longer a secret. The contempt was obvious, and relentless. And it was harnessed for clear strategic purposes at the debate. Everyone — even candidates who don’t seem to be in the center of the New Hampshire action — felt it was in their interest to pile on the former Massachusetts governor. Romney may have been knocked from front-runner status in Iowa, but this night he was at the center — of a rhetorical firing squad. Four of Romney’s Republican opponents joined together to put him through a grueling evening, taking turns offering derisive quips and questions about his authenticity and throwing him on the defensive at a critical moment for his campaign. Being on the defensive was exactly what Romney could not afford. Trailing John McCain in the latest New Hampshire polls by as much as 7 points, Romney was hoping to attack McCain on immigration and taxes only to spend most of his time fending off the attacks of most of his rivals.Fred Thompson, meanwhile, bringing up the rear in New Hampshire polls, acquitted himself well by mostly staying above the fray. Many observers believe he actually won the debate although as far as which candidate benefitted the most it would have to be McCain. Romney did well enough but hardly touched his rival. All the candidates will have another chance tonight on the Fox News debate.","at0800600_1.text","Conservative",6,"at"
"26","Last night's ABC debate among Democratic candidates featured a double barrelled attack on Hillary Clinton from Barack Obama and John Edwards:Senator Barack Obama and John Edwards went after Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as never before in a televised debate here on Saturday night. With Mr. Obama hoping that a victory in New Hampshire, following his first-place finish in Iowa, would make him difficult to beat in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination — and with Mr. Edwards looking to defeat Mrs. Clinton in a second straight contest — they entered an alliance of convenience. In an exchange that summed up the basic story line of the contest, they cast her as a candidate of the status quo who would fail to deliver the changes in government that many Democratic voters demand. With the New Hampshire primary two days away, Mrs. Clinton found her courage, likability and judgment questioned. But she fought back as she did when she was first lady of Arkansas and of the United States — with defiance and flashes of anger, pursing her lips, stiffening her back and staring intently at her rivals.Leaving aside the goo-goo eyed Times description of how Hillary Clinton responded to the attacks on her, the fact is her campaign is sinking in New Hampshire and it's pretty obvious they don't know how to turn it around. From a double digit lead for Hillary last week, two polls out yesterday show that Clinton and Obama are in a virtual tie on the eve of Tuesday's primary. And the excitement and momentum all seem to be with the Illinois senator, especially given the media frenzy over his historic win in Iowa on Thursday.But Clinton still has an enormous amount of money in the bank (some estimates place it at $21 million) and a huge lead in delgates thanks to her wrapping up so many of the ""super delegates"" to the convention next August. A loss in New Hamspshire would be a blow but not a fatal one. There is still Super Tuesday ahead on February 5 where she will win several northeastern states and is still competitive in California.And Obama is still very inexperienced. The chances of him making a serious blunder or verbal gaffe between now and February cannot be dismissed. And with the probability that she would be the only candidate positioned to take advantage of such a mistake, counting out Hillary Clinton, never a good strategy to begin with, is not in the cards.","at0800600_2.text","Conservative",6,"at"
"27","Dick Morris, former Clinton campaign guru, on some scenarios coming out of New Hampshire for the Democrats:Hillary cannot be knocked out even if she loses all the early primaries. Her berth in the finals is assured by her national standing, her strength among “super delegates"" (Congressmen, Senators, Governors and State Party Chairmen who automatically get votes at the convention) and her financial clout. But she can and will be bloodied. Meanwhile, if Obama wins in New Hampshire, particularly if he does so by a convincing margin (which we think is likely) he will probably go on to sweep Nevada and South Carolina, the other two early primaries. His status as front runner will be solidified - and that's where his troubles will start. Once Hillary is no longer in the dock, undergoing the scrutiny of being a front runner, Obama will have to endure the slings and arrows. Hillary will probably play the race card. Not overtly and not directly, but she will speak in code saying that Obama can't win. What that really means is that a black cannot prevail in 2008 in the United States. We, presumably, aren't ready. But Obama will benefit from a generational surge that animated his Iowa victory. In the caucuses, he carried voters under 30 by four-to-one. In a contest that had been about transcending race and gender, the key factor on which it turned was age. Generation X saw in Obama a way to push the boomers off the stage, taking their drugs and permissive lifestyle with them. To these young voters, Obama is the future and the Clintons are the distant past. He believes Edwards has no chance and will drop out soon after New Hampshire. As for the Republicans: Unless Huckabee shows real momentum by a Michigan or a Florida win. If it appears likely that the GOP field will come down to Rudy, McCain and Huckabee, the economic conservatives (Rush Limbaugh et al) will realize that they have no horse on which to bet. On taxes and fiscal issues, they see McCain as too liberal for opposing Bush's tax cut and worry about Huckabee's spending and tax policies in Arkansas. They might back Rudy but his pro choice position scares them. So . . . they may need to breathe new life into either Thompson or Romney. The former task is like raising the dead, so they may settle on Romney giving Mitt a new lease on life. Most likely, Rudy, McCain, Huckabee and Romney all compete on Super Tuesday and none of them wins a majority. Then it goes to Ohio and Texas who vote in early March . . . or, quite possibly, to the convention floor. The prospects for a brokered convention are still remote. But if the Republicans have 3 (or more) viable candidates emerging from the Super Tuesday gaggle of 21 primaries where more than half Republican convention delegates will be chosen, the chances rise dramatically.

"28","Neil MacFarquahar of the New York Times artfully navigates politically sensitive waters with an article on the problem of wife-beating among Muslims in the United States. The general question, simply put, is how to admit a pattern of outrageous behavior by designated victim groups, without provoking a serious reaction of outrage. So the reportage is artfully constructed to imply that solution as well as the problem lie within Islam, and non-Muslims have a minor role, if any, to play.Thus, the article begins with insensitive Americans failing to accommodate the special needs of battered women who happen to be Muslim:After enduring seven years of beatings from her husband, a young Yemeni-American woman recently fled to a local shelter, only to find that the heavy black head scarf she wore as an observant Muslim provoked disapproval. The shelter brought in a hairdresser, whose services she accepted without any misgivings. But once her hair was styled, administrators urged her to throw off her veil, saying it symbolized the male oppression native to Islam that she wanted to escape.Rather than dwelling on the insensitivities of the battered women's services branch of American feminism, the Times quickly moves on to the heroines of the piece, the forces within the American Muslim community seeking to provide Islamically-correct shelter services, and avoiding conceding that there might be any special problem among Muslims, despite the awkward fact that the Koran endorses beating women.scattered organizations founded by Muslim American women are creating a movement to define it as an unacceptable cultural practice. The problem occurs among American Muslims at the same rate as other groups, activists say, but is even more sensitive because raising the issue is considered an attack on the faith. ""The Muslim community is under a lot of scrutiny, so they are reluctant to look within to face their problems because it will substantiate the arguments demonizing them,"" said Rafia Zakaria, a political science graduate student at Indiana University who is starting a legal defense fund for Muslim women. ""It puts Muslim women in a difficult position because if they acknowledge their rights, they are seen as being in some kind of collusion with all those who are attacking Muslim men. So the question is how to speak out without adding to the stereotype that Muslim men are barbaric, oppressive, terrible people.""To no one's surprise, as the Times reportss it, one of the biggest problems (as always) is the racism (in this case ""Islamophobia"") of ordinary Americans. But for all the hate-filled bigots populating the United States, the problem would be much more manageable. We just need to realize that head coverings, burkhas, and the like are part of the gorgeous mosaic we celebrate as diversity.While the Times is usually gung-ho for change when it has identified a feminist issue in which women are victimized (think on-campus rape), there is little focus on voices calling for a rapid solution that would put a halt to widespread abuse. Instead, readers are informed,...activists expect real change will only come with the next generation of Muslim women here, raised in an American context that condemns such violence.  And what about that Koranic injunction?To counter opposition rooted in religious texts, Mr. Magid [an Islamic cleric in Virginia]  and others use the example of Prophet Muhammad. There is no record of him striking one of his wives; rather, he would withdraw when angered.... Mr. Magid should know that there is such a record. This line is found in about the middle of a long hadith. Aisha, Muhammad's child-wife, is speaking:He [Muhammad] struck me on the chest which caused me pain....Mr. Magid does acknowledge that there are certain other scriptural problems:The raging debate comes with Chapter 4, Verse 34 in the Koran, long interpreted as giving husbands the right to strike their wives as the final step in an escalating series of punishments for being rebellious.Maha B. Alkhateeb, who helped edit a book on domestic violence called ""Change From Within,"" is among the leading activists pushing a new interpretation of the verse that understands it as calling for women to be obedient to God.But given that the Koran is considered the unassailable word of God, it is particularly difficult for young, often secular women to promote a new interpretation.Oddly enough, the verse in question is not cited. Could that possibly be because it seems rather unbambiguous? One translation:  Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great.James Arlandson covered the subject of domestic violence in the Koran for AT readers almost three years ago, and included analysis of the claims of those who deny that husbandly violence against wives receives sanction.Hat tip: Jack Kemp (not the politician)","at0800600_4.text","Conservative",6,"at"
"29","George Tenet has engaged counsel to represent him in the investigation of the destruction of the CIA's interrogation tapes of top Al Qaeda figures. According to Newsweek, he's engaged Howard M. Shapiro. If Mr. Shapiro's name rings a bell, it should. He was criticized for his role in Clinton's filegate scandal. Neil Lewis of the New York Times wrote in 1997: Mr. Shapiro became the focus of criticism for several reasons. He is both a close associate of Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, and he was at the center of the bureau's internal investigation of the improper transfer to the White House of more than 900 confidential background files in 1993, many of them on prominent Republicans. The files were provided to the White House at the request of Craig M. Livingstone, who headed the White House security office even though he was a political campaign operative without any law-enforcement experience. Mr. Clinton has insisted that the acquisition of the files was an innocent if sizable mistake while Republicans expressed suspicion that it was part of an effort to collect intelligence on political rivals. The issue of the files remains a mystery, and the White House has not yet said who hired Mr. Livingstone for such a sensitive post. Last year, House Republicans called on Mr. Freeh to dismiss Mr. Shapiro for some of the steps he had taken while trying to determine how the confidential files came to be sent to the White House. Republicans eventually acceded to a plan by the Justice Department to have its internal watchdog unit evaluate Mr. Shapiro's actions. In its report today, the Justice Department's investigative unit said that although Mr. Shapiro had not engaged in any professional misconduct, some of his actions had ''exacerbated a political problem by contributing to the appearance that the F.B.I., and particularly Shapiro, was not sufficiently independent of the White House.''He had also taken it upon himself to send over to the White House the book manuscript of former FBI agent Gary Aldrich, which had been critical of Clinton.","at0800600_5.text","Conservative",6,"at"
"30","In today's article, Only McCain can beat Obama, Richard Baehr made a case for Senator McCain as the GOP nomination for the President of the United States in 2008, but this writer disagrees.The word from the trenches is that many Republicans, this writer included, are sick and tired of Democrat-lite candidates or rather, Republicans-in-Name-Only, (RINOs), heading up any tickets for the GOP. Moving to the left is clearly not what Americans really want, as exhibiting by staunch conservative Bobby Jindal's victory in Louisiana. It is time for all Republicans to demand that we move back to what the GOP used to stand for, less government, lower taxes, anti illegal immigration, fiscal responsibility, and a strong military, both offensive and defensive.John McCain says that he is for a strong America but then unbelievably votes against it, time and again. For example, he voted YES on banning drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Mar 05) when it's clear that not only can it be done cleanly (Alaskan Pipeline) but that America can begin to take itself off of foreign oil as we strive for alternative energy. But what is odder is that Senator McCain voted to defund renewable and solar energy exploration back in June of 1999 which is the incentive for companies to do research on cleaner fuels for America. Indeed, as of December 2006, McCain received a 17% rating by CAF which indicates that Senator McCain is opposed to US energy independence. Why would anyone vote again that?Next, Senator McCain is awful fond of banning things, which, as Republicans, we should not be embracing. He voted, in June 2006, on a Constitutional ban on burning the US Flag. As a veteran, I find flag-burning to be obnoxious and disgusting but it is protected under the First Amendment. And speaking of banning things, Senator McCain is also for banning ""certain"" assault weapons, banning ""cheap"" guns (whatever they are), and requiring safety locks. (1999-2000). As the GOP, we are not into limiting personal behavior, personal safety, nor infringing on state's rights, which Senator McCain seems more than willing to do. Indeed, Senator McCain is also against an ""unfiltered"" Internet as he deems that it steals the ""innocence"" away for America's children. (More Federal interference anyone?) In August of 1999, McCain stated that violent web sites and videos are a problem. True enough but this writer believes that it is the parent's responsibility to raise their children NOT the federal government. Unless of course, Senator McCain thinks it takes a village like Hillary Clinton does. These, however, are the traits of a RINO, or Democrat-lite, not a Republican.Probably the worst stance that a GOPer would find on Senator McCain is his stance on illegal immigration. In November of 2007, McCain stated that illegal immigrant's are ""God's children."" That's nice John, but they can be ""God's children"" in their own nation. Even more stunning is his stance back in October of 2004 wherein he stated that he would like to give everyone in the world an opportunity to live in America! This writer HOPES that he will exclude  free-loaders in that ""open-door"" policy as we have enough already! As of December 2006, the USBC gives Senator McCain a rating of 18% which means that he is an ""open-border"" advocate. And in keeping with his wish for the whole world to move here, he's voted YES on things like: Amnesty. Allowing illegal aliens to participate in S.S.  No more ballot initiatives AGAINST immigration. Giving guest workers a path to citizenship. Allowing MORE foreign workers in the US for ""farm work"".Senator McCain states that illegals do the jobs Americans won't do but how can we really know that while the illegals are still here, working those jobs, cheaper than American's can? In the arena of government, Senator McCain takes a big government stance in some areas while slicing and dicing in others. Unfortunately, his ideas are 180 degree out from what a real Republican would shoot for. He is of course, against term limits, claiming that term limits will get rid of the good along with the bad, which is of course, pure hogwash. It prevents the development of corrupt career politicians and encourages action not blathering and dithering, all of which are rife on The Hill. In September of 1998, while Bill Clinton was destroying the US military, Senator McCain was also calling for a reduction in governmental scope and size...including the US military. That is not what a true Reagan Republican would want. Moreover, if McCain wanted to downsize the Federal government, then why would he want to Federalize aviation security, which, when compared to private security, consistently underperforms while overcharging and unionizing?It appears that Senator McCain is somewhat confused about the traits of a Republican when, for example, in 1994 he voted to end the Vietnam embargo, voted for normal trade relations with Vietnam in 2001, yet votes to maintain the Cuban Embargo, which in reality, is a joke. Even more odd is his position that America should overthrow ""rogue"" governments in order to keep America safe (2000) yet he calls waterboarding torture, even though no physical harm is done. McCain also thinks that we should consult LAWYERS on war decisions (2007) so that we don't go to war ""half-cocked"". Now THAT is a joke. He wants to close Gitmo, apparently sending the terrorists back where they came from to fight against us again but he calls for the US to indict Castro! Yet back in September of 2006, McCain voted NO to compel the CIA to provide written reports the interrogation methods of the detainees. Also, he voted NO back in July 2005, to restrict US business with entities linked to terrorism. It simply does not add up the way Senator McCain thinks and this essay does not even take him to task for that horrid McCain/Feingold Act, again, limiting freedom.Let's examine a few more of Senator McCain's votes which stray far from the Republican plantation. Voted YES on setting aside 10% of highway funds for minorities & women. (Mar 1998) Voted NO on ending special funding for minority & women-owned business. (Oct 1997) Regulate nicotine as a drug. (Jul 1998) Remove charitable deduction; it only benefits rich. (Jan 2000) Middle-class tax cut: expand 15% tax bracket. (Jan 2000)What this writer finds the most disturbing is that McCain promises a middle-class tax cut but wants to expand the 15% tax bracket where many middle-class Americans fall smack into! Also, removing the charitable deduction does not just help the rich, it helps millions of Americans, including this writer, who give freely to charities across the land to get a little back for donating. Why would a Republican want to remove that? The answer is a real Republican would not.Senator McCain, as we have seen above, is NOT a Republican and should not, in any way, shape, or form, be on the 2008 Republican ticket. He is an open border advocate as is Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and George Soros! He has fought against term limits, one of the issues that millions of Americans want and demand, as well as fighting against our dependence on foreign oil! Senator McCain's stance on the issues is typically like a Democrat's; that is, any which way the wind blows. It is high-time that Republicans stood up and demanded that we get candidates who uphold our Party's platform. If not, then we can either sit at home or write in the only real conservative on the ticket, Fred Thompson's name, in disgust over the RINOs (Romney, Giuliani, and McCain). Maybe the GOP needs a tour out in the wilderness in order to produce another Reagan. But in any event, this writer, and probably many more Americans won't be voting for a RINO in November so to the RNC, here is a helpful hint: ""reexamine who you put forth on the ticket, unless wandering in the wilderness is something you enjoy.""","at0800700_0.text","Conservative",7,"at"
"31","The prospect of a ringing defeat in New Hampshire has led to speculation that Hillary Clinton soon will fold up her tent and abandon the quest that has animated most of her adult life. I don't buy it. Not now.I see a slightly different scenario playing out. But then again, I am prone to a certain amount of wishful thinking when it comes to the fate of the former First Lady/junior Senator from New York.Robert Schrum speculates  that Hillary may be running out of money:She has probably spent much of the $100 million that she's raised, and last week her big givers were being urgently importuned to raise more. Incredibly, the one-time Dem juggernaut may struggle financially to reach Feb. 5.I am not nearly as wired-in to Team Clinton as Schrum, but I have never noticed a weakness in the fund-raising department when it comes to the Clintons. They know how to lean on the moneybags. In the worst instance, a personal loan to the campaign from the ample Clinton coffers could keep her in the race until the February primaries. I would love to hear the conversation between the loving couple when Hill asks Bill to co-sign the loan, though.It is probably true that more members of the Clinton machine, political pros who may see a looming post-Clinton era and want to have a career in it, may be contemplating jumping ship. So the question becomes what would Hillary do about defectors, especially those who join the Obama surge?If the past is any guide, pressure will be brought to bear. No need to specify what kind of pressure it might be, but the Clinton machine has long demonstrated an ability to keep its own house in order when it comes to protecting secrets and supporting the boss.Which raises the interesting possibility of insiders spilling their guts in retaliation for the retaliation they have received after jumping ship. There are a lot of people who have observed the Clintons in a lot of trying circumstances. If it truly looks like the SS Clinton has taken on water, is listing and about to sink,  then the floodgates could open.It is too soon to actually predict a Wagnerian Götterdämmerung, but neither can one be ruled out as a pure fantasy.For now, that mere possibility will do quite nicely. All of a sudden, Hillary has become my candidate of hope for change.Hat tip: Clarice Feldman  Update:Just heard the tearing-up speech and agree with Rush that it was a strategized move, intended to evoke sympathy.She's long been told she needs to humanize herself, so that voters can connect with her. She is also known to have charmed plenty of people in high level small gatherings. Robert Shrum wrote today:Contrary to the caricatures, Hillary Clinton is a real person, often funny in private, with engaging qualities that have been well-hidden in this campaign. But the hour is late and even if the real Hillary emerges, voters might see it as just another contrivance.I see that charm-emitting small group sub-personality as another contrivance, too. Hillary has a number of distinctly different modes of behavior, appropriate to her goals and circumstances. Someone like Shrum would see Hillary's passionate and vulnerable side as the ""real Hillary"" whereas I see it as another behavioral modality, used mostly on people she needs to cultivate. It is a private side, which makes it seem real to those experiencing it.But there are other private sides: the unimportant staff, treated coldly; and of course, the private side with Bill. We hear of the stormy, foul-mouthed raging arguments because they are so audible. But who knows what else?Update:Clarice Feldman emails me: ""Edwards' guy Joe Trippi says she is out of money--she had $35 million in Oct and is spending $20 a month. For what it's worth.""That is an incredible cash burn. So she will have to cut back drastically if she stays in the race. She operated regally because she believed in her own inevitability. That is too much to raise suddenly.Maybe she is smart enough to see the handwriting on the wall. Nothing like firing a lot of insiders to generate bad press. IF she does pull the plug and wants to stay in politics as a Senator, she needs to handle this with dignity, and undoubtedly is aiming for sympathy. Tearing-up but keeping control could be the first step in withdrawing.The Götterdämmerung remains a fantasy.","at0800700_1.text","Conservative",7,"at"
"32","You can judge a man (or a political movement) by his enemies. Tom Maguire notes an interesting thing about the left:Let me see if I understand this - John Edwards and the Krugman Democrats want to negotiate with the Iranians and North Koreans but not the drug companies or health insurers.Well, as long as we are clear who the bad guys are.Commenter Steveaz explains the thinking:I'm seeing a pattern here.If a threat is real and deadly, the Democrats want to talk to it, not ""fight"" it.But if a threat is illusory, mundane, and invisible, then the Democrats want to ""fight"" it. Of course, their idea of a fight is to convene a commission. But just like their ""war"" on poverty, the Dem's ""fights"" against ""Big Pharma"" and ""Big Oil"" are only attempts to gain votes.Maybe it's better that the Democrats won't ""fight"" Iranian nukes and global Islamofascism. If they did, we'd have to sit thru CNN's ""analysis"" of a zillion politicized commission-reports, And a Valerie Plame, a Gorelick, or a Downing Street Memo can always get slipped into these committees to ensure the ""punches"" fall on the Left's favorite villains: Americans and Republicans.No wonder why when Dems are in charge our enemies steal our lunch money.","at0800700_2.text","Conservative",7,"at"
"33","Are these guys suicidal or what?A couple of Iranian patrol boats took off after three US naval warships and, according to the Pentagon, ""harrased"" the ships in the narrow Straits of Hormuz:In what U.S. officials called a serious provocation, Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats harassed and provoked three U.S. Navy ships in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, threatening to explode the American vessels. U.S. forces were on the verge of firing on the Iranian boats in the early Sunday incident, when the boats turned and moved away, a Pentagon official said. ""It is the most serious provocation of this sort that we've seen yet,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record. The incident occurred at about 5 a.m. local time Sunday as a U.S. Navy cruiser, destroyer and frigate were on their way into the Persian Gulf and passing through the strait - a major oil shipping route. Five small boats began charging the U.S. ships, dropping boxes in the water in front of the ships and forcing the U.S. ships to take evasive maneuvers, the Pentagon official said. There were no injuries but the official said there could have been, because the Iranian boats turned away ""literally at the very moment that U.S. forces were preparing to open fire"" in self defense. The official said he didn't have the precise transcript of communications that passed between the two forces, but said the Iranians radioed something like ""we're coming at you and you'll explode in a couple minutes.""Iran has been aggressive against US ships in the Straits before. But this kind of action smacks of suicide - something it appears they wanted the Americans to think. More likely they were hoping to start an incident that would have the rest of the world calling for the Navy to leave the Persian Gulf alltogether.Not very smart - but neither is buzzing a missile frigate. Our seamen have a long memory and few forget what happened to the USS Cole when a small boat filled with explosives crashed into her, killing 17 men.No doubt there will be more incidents of this nature in the future as the Iranians continue to test our resolve.","at0800700_3.text","Conservative",7,"at"
"34","I almost didn't want to blog about this today but it was the last debate before voting begins and some of you may have wondered why a premier political site like AT wasn't covering it. I'm talking about the Republican Debate last night on Fox. For those who were able to keep awake through it all, I congratulate you. I, myself was unable to keep my eyes open and missed the last 15 thrilling minutes. But from what I saw, I would make the following observations.1. Mitt Romney had his best debate in months and may have reversed the McCain momentum a little. It probably won't be enough for him to win but it will keep him close enough that he can go on to Michigan with some confidence. In fact, if he can narrow the gap to 5 points or less, Romney may be able to claim a comeback of sorts.2. McCain disappeared last night. He was subdued and had little energy. Perhaps he was playing it safe. If so, he made a mistake.3. Mike Huckabee lacked his usual charm and wit, couldn't answer a direct question about his tax increases while governor of Arkansas, and generally stunk up the place. For his sake, I hope no one in South Carolina was watching.4. Fred Thompson should employ a comfy red chair rather than his red pickup truck as a campaign symbol. Thompson has excelled in these roundtable debates where everyone is seated and the mood is a little more relaxed. His performance won't help him in New Hampshire but for his sake, I hope everyone in South Carolina was watching. 5. Rudy Giuliani was better last night than he was in the ABC debate on Saturday. But the focus has gone off of Giuliani and he is going to have to find a way to recapture interest in his campaign. Right now, no one cares about Florida which is where Rudy is pinning most of his hopes. He seems to have moved into the background with the focus on these early primaries.Summary: Fred won on points. Romney on style and because he needed to hit a home run, should be declared the overall winner.I'd say McCain was the loser because he failed to rise to the challenge and appeared to be resting on his laurels. It shouldn't hurt him enough that he loses tomorrow but it will probably take away some of his momentum.","at0800700_4.text","Conservative",7,"at"
"35","Drudge notes that there is talk about Hillary withdrawing altogether from the race for the Democratic nomination, indicating staffers are concerned about protecting the Clinton brand.But I suspect Jay Cost  has a better explanation: This is not 1992 any more and she has not the numerical and geographic advantages that made it possible for him to be ""the comeback kid"" who came from behind to walk off with the nomination:Super Tuesday was designed by southern Democrats after Mondale's nomination in 1984. They wanted to use their weight to nominate a more moderate candidate who would better reflect their interests. The plan backfired in 1988, as Al Gore and Jesse Jackson effectively neutralized one another, and Michael Dukakis won the nomination. But the plan succeeded in 1992 -- as Bill Clinton lost seven of the first nine contests, but still won the nomination.This points out a critical difference between Bill and Hillary. Bill won the nomination when the battle came to his home turf. The South was Clinton's firewall in 1992. It was going to get behind Bill almost regardless of where he finished in the previous contests. Hillary has no firewall that is based upon regional affinity. Of course, she is currently strong in many of this year's Super Tuesday states -- California, New Jersey, Connecticut, etc. However, she is not a favorite daughter. These states are not nearly as dependable for her as Tennessee, Mississippi, and South Carolina were for Bill.Another critical difference can be noted when we look at the results of the early contests. Of the contests prior to Super Tuesday, they were split five ways: Harkin, Kerrey, Tsongas, Brown, and Clinton all won at least one contest before March 10. There was no significant consolidation of the race because the early states kept disagreeing with one another. This helped Bill. He could lose and lose and lose because no single opponent won and won and won. Hillary does not enjoy this kind of advantage. The 2008 Democratic contest is between Clinton and Obama. So, if she loses seven of the first eight contests contests, Obama wins seven of the first eight. This would create a dramatically different dynamic than in 1992.Thus, we see here two of Clinton's relative weaknesses as a frontrunner. She has no firewall that stems from her geographical roots. She also does not have the luxury of multiple opponents.","at0800700_5.text","Conservative",7,"at"
"36","President Pervez Musharraf said in an interview broadcast last night on ""60 Minutes"" that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was to blame for her own assassination:For standing up outside the car, I think it was she to blame alone -- nobody else. Responsibility is hers,"" the former general told CBS' ""60 Minutes."" Bhutto was killed December 27 in Rawalpindi, south of the Pakistani capital Islamabad, while she was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for now-postponed parliamentary elections. Her head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack. The cause of her death is not clear: a bomber blew himself up near Bhutto's limousine and videotape showed a gunman present, though no autopsy has been carried out. Asked if Bhutto could have been shot, Musharraf said, ""Yes, absolutely, yes. Possibility."" He has said he welcomes an international investigation. Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to Bhutto, who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister. He noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and ""was given more security than any other person.""Musharraf isn't doing himself any good with western audiences by blaming the victim for her own death. But his claim appeals to some factions in Pakistan who opposed the former prime minister's return to power - including the military and some of the religious parties.By absolving the military of any blame whatsoever, Musharraf stays in their good graces while avoiding the touchy situation of acknowledging their incompetence in protecting Bhutto. And his ""welcoming"" an international investigation is a sham. He will place so many obstacles in their path that he will insure that they never discover the entire truth of what happened. Musharraf has been doing this with the United States for years - saying he will do something and never following through. It's getting to be an old song and dance by now and Musharraf performs it expertly.","at0800700_6.text","Conservative",7,"at"

John McCain would be a significant feat on Tuesday. The almost frantic downsizing of expectations for the former Massachusetts governor came as the candidate and his staff are publicly and privately preparing to explain away what would be a disheartening loss and shift to a last-ditch strategy predicated on his ability to outlast and outspend his rivals, according to sources inside the campaign. ""This is a must-win state for him,"" Romney said of McCain, in a Politico interview Sunday. ""If he doesn't win here, I don't know where he is going to win. So for me it's can I catch John McCain — can I keep him from getting this?"" McCain's candidacy, left for dead last summer, was reviving even before the candidate's strong 3rd place finish in Iowa. Now he finds himself 5-7 points ahead of Romney in the latest polls. For Romney, it is a bitter pill. To see his hard work in Iowa and New Hampshire come to naught torpedoes his plan for winning the early primaries and coasting to victory. Now it's on to plan B - something no one is sure he has.Romney must stay close to McCain so that he can come back next week and win the Michigan primary - the state of his birth.

"38","A candidate winning Iowa usually gets a ""bump"" in support that shows up in New Hampshire.This is more like an earthquake:Amid frenetic last-minute campaigning, a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll finds the onetime front-runners in New Hampshire lagging as Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain have surged to leads before Tuesday's primary. Obama vaulted to a 13 percentage-point advantage over New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton three weeks after they were tied here. McCain gained a four-point edge over Mitt Romney, a former governor of neighboring Massachusetts who has campaigned almost as a favorite son. The poll results spotlight the phenomenal rise of the 46-year-old senator from Illinois, who would be the first African-American nominated by a major party for president, and the 71-year-old senator from Arizona whose cash-short campaign was dismissed as all but over last summer.So what happened? Independents are breaking massively for Obama. It appears to me that many Independents and Democrats were looking for an excuse to throw Hillary under a bus. That excuse was Iowa and the surging enthusiasm generated by Obama's candidacy has been obvious since Friday morning. Hillary is not done, not by a long shot. As Richard Baehr points out in his excellent article today: In the coming months as her campaign unravels, it will not be pretty. A woman who has aimed for the White House for 40 years, lived through her husband's success and thought this time was hers, will not go quietly or in a dignified fashion into the night. One can sense the seething bitterness over this young interloper arriving on the scene to trump her glass ceiling-breaking vision of the first woman president with a much bigger ceiling-smasher, race. I think Hillary has one last argument to make on her behalf; the idea that the early primary states have too much pull in the nominating process. This may play well on Super Tuesday and give her enough victories to halt the Obama juggernaut. But in the end, Obama's positive message of change will probably overwhelm her. It could very well be that people simply want to get beyond the Clinton-Bush years and start over again - something that has happened time and time again in American history.","at0800700_8.text","Conservative",7,"at"

"41","Mark Levin at The Corner was ""floored"" when he read it this morning:Heading into South Carolina, where illegal immigration appears to be the biggest issue among Republicans, Huckabee is going to support a constitutional amendment prohibiting birthright citizenship? Did I not hear him in several debates, including on Sunday, admonishing those of us who've long opposed birthright citizenship, about God's children coming out of the shadows? Is this not the same man who only a few months ago supported McCain-Kennedy? Romney has explained his conversion on abortion — the day it occurred, how it occurred, and why it occurred. We have to make judgments about the credibility of a politician making a conversion, based on their records, recent statements, and ultimately, character. You can accept it or not. But for Huckabee to throw on the table such a dramatic shift of position from one day to the next, just before the South Carolina primary, without ever indicating such a view during any of the debates or in any of his many media appearances since the beginning of his run for president, is to me as cynical as it gets in a season of cynical acts.Nearly 50% of South Carolina voters are Christian conservatives who apparently pay little attention to the media or to whatever Huckabee said last week for that matter. Mike Huckabee will probably win the South Carolina primary because of these voters who proved in Iowa that their candidate could be a flip flopping con artist but as long as his heart is in the right place on their issues, he will be their man.As for the rest of us, all we can do is stand back in awe and marvel at the chutzpah of a man who is flim flamming the public as he goes along.UPDATE: Huckabee DenialVia correspondent Sallyvee, It seems there is some disarray in the Huckabee camp today.The former Arkansas governor is denying the story that he supports a constitutional amendment denying birthright citizenship:I do not support an amendment to the constitution that would prevent children born in the U.S. to illegal aliens from automatically becoming American citizens.  I have no intention of supporting a constitutional amendment to deny birthright citizenship.  The confusion arose this morning in a Washington Times story where Minuteman founder James Gilchrist told the Times that Huckabee supported the amendment, Huckabee now says that simply isn't true which raises the question why Gilchrist, who is supporting Huckabee now, would have supported him to begin with.It turns out, according to NRO's Byron York, that Gilchrist sent out questionaires to all the candidates and Huckabee was the only one who responded. That's why he got the organization's endorsement.I think Gilchrist should probably go back to playing soldier on the border while the adults handle politics.","at0800800_1.text","Conservative",8,"at"
"42","The 2006 National Geographic-Roper Survey of Geographic Literacy is out and our 18-24 year olds must have been asleep during geography class, judging by the results.People were shown a blank map of the Middle East and asked to identify four countries; Iran, Iraq, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.The results were not encouraging. Only 14% of the people who took the test were able to identify where all four countries were on the map.Individually, 63% didn't know where Iraq and Saudi Arabia were while an astonishing 75% couldn't place Iran or Israel on the map.It seems amazing but fully 44% of the respondents couldn't find any of the countries.From the report:Education makes a difference in young adults’ ability to locate these four countries in the headlines: young Americans with college experience (1.6 correct answers on average) are more likely than those with up to a high school education (0.9 correct) to locate these countries. That said, even the more educated group fares relatively poorly, with less than a quarter of those with a college education able to find all four countries (23%, 6% of those with up to a high school diploma).(HT: MESH) Why this is so, the report doesn't say. My own belief is that a de-emphasis on traditional subjects like geography and science in the early grades has led to a geographically challenged and scientific illiterate electorate.Yes, but students know where the root of all evil in the world lies thanks to slanted social studies textbooks that tell them how rotten their own country is.","at0800800_2.text","Conservative",8,"at"

In light of that, this news about a new joint US-Iraqi military operation to combat the terrorists is not surprising:U.S. and Iraqi forces launched a major operation to strike against al-Qaeda in Iraq and other extremists, the U.S. military said Tuesday, in an effort to build on a recent overall reduction of violence and push militants from their strongholds. The division and brigade-level operation, dubbed Phantom Phoenix, will cover the entire country, the military said. ""Phantom Phoenix will synchronize lethal and non-lethal effects to exploit recent security gains and disrupt terrorist support zones and enemy command and control,"" the military said in a statement.Kicked out of western and central Iraq by a combination of US troops and Sunni tribesmen and out of Baghdad and its environs by a combination of American military skill and citizen cooperation, al-Qaeda has gone to the north where the Kurds have recently been fighting them and where some successful suicide bombers have hit recently. There will be some concentration of forces there in order to assist the Kurds in taking out the terrorists.Soon, the terrorists will literally have no place to go where they can set up shop and cause trouble.

"44","Trying to position himself as a candidate that independents could rally around as an alternative to the two parties, New York billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg has seen his aspirations for the presidency disappear over the last few days in the boom accompanying the candidacy of Barack Obama:Mr. Obama has stressed that he wants to move beyond gridlocked politics and usher in an era of national unity. A key organizer of the effort to draft Mr. Bloomberg for a presidential run acknowledged in an interview on Monday that that Mr. Obama’s rise could be problematic. “Obama is trying to reach out to independent voters, and that clearly would be the constituency that Mike Bloomberg would go after,” said Andrew MacRae, who heads the Washington chapter of Draft Mike Bloomberg for President 2008. “An Obama victory does not make it impossible, but it certainly makes it more difficult.” The event was organized by former Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, with former Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma. In the days leading up the event here, just outside Oklahoma City, Mr. Boren suggested that he would encourage Mr. Bloomberg to run if the major party nominees failed to heed the call for bipartisanship. But several leading participants took pains to say that they had no intention of abandoning their own parties in the election. Some even cast Mr. Obama’s success as evidence that the nation was yearning for the type of leadership they were offering. There is no doubt that a Bloomberg run is in the offing - if there were no candidate who was attracting the majority independent vote of the country. But with Obama's support among independents hovering at around 50%, there doesn't appear to be any room for Bloomberg to position himself as a candidate who could bring change to Washington. Third parties historically have it tough in America. While Bloombergs billions would make the Mayor competitive, the dyamics of the race have changed so drastically since Iowa that it is not likely he will jump in the race now.","at0800800_4.text","Conservative",8,"at"
"45","The question of why Hillary Clinton's candidacy is in freefall at the moment was answered at a forum featuring her husband Bill at Dartmouth College:About thirty minutes into Bill Clinton's nearly two-hour stop here at Dartmouth College, a steady stream of students started walking out of the venue. Moments later, Clinton -- his voice hoarse, sometimes cracking -- took arguably the toughest question of the night, courtesy of a tall, blond 19-year old freshman wearing a bright red sweater. ""My main concern is, if Hillary were elected, it would create a dynastification of American politics. Bush, Clinton, Bush. What do you think?"" asked Sebastian Ramirez, standing less than a hundred feet from the former president. Clinton responded, to rolling laughter across the room, ""I'm not responsible for the 12 years that the American people gave to the Bushes."" He continued: ""I actually tried to talk Hillary into leaving me when we were in law school, that's the God's truth. I told her, 'You have more talent for public service than anybody in my generation that I have met... I shouldn't stand in your way.' She looked at me and said, 'Oh, Bill, I'll never run for office.'"" That got a few cheers from the crowd of about 600, most of them students, with their backpacks and books in tow. But many of the students in the room, judging from more than two dozen interviews, are supporters of Sen. Barack Obama. They plan to vote for him tomorrow night. ""I am not anti-Hillary, I am not anti-Clinton, I love Bill Clinton. But I just think we need a fresh start, a new face,"" Ramirez told The Trail. ""All my life I've known the Clintons. As much as I like them, it's time for someone like Barack.""Change is a powerful theme in politics. And after 20 years of Clintons and Bushes, the American people are plain fed up. The same way people tired of the Kennedys running for President, voters are rejecting Hillary Clinton because finally, they realize that as much as some would like a woman president, the fact that she's a Clinton outweighs all other considerations.She should have divorced Bill and then announced her candidacy.","at0800800_5.text","Conservative",8,"at"
"46","Six months ago, last July 8, the New York Times published an editorial entitled ""The Road Home""  and called for the U.S. to exit from Iraq and abandon a lost cause.  The first sentence read:It is time for the United States to leave Iraq, without any more delay than the Pentagon needs to organize an orderly exit.In short, the NYT called for an orderly withdrawal-something akin to the U.S. Marines' 1950 retreat from the Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War. The editorial read:While Mr. Bush scorns deadlines, he kept promising breakthroughs-after elections, after a constitution, after sending in thousands more troops.  But those milestones came and went without any progress toward a stable, democratic Iraq or a path for withdrawal. It is frighteningly clear that Mr. Bush's plan is to stay the course as long as he is president and dump the mess on his successor.  Whatever his cause was, it is lost.   The scions of the Gray Lady, declaring the war lost, announced that:Additional military forces poured into the Baghdad region have failed to change anything. The editors dispensed their wisdom with dispassionate candor. In withdrawing from Iraq, Americans should expect undesirable outcomes to impact on the people of the region. Americans must be clear that Iraq, and the region around it, could be even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans leave.  There could be reprisals against those who worked with American forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide.  Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and Syria.  Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make power grabs.  Perhaps more important, the invasion has created a new strong from which terrorists activity could proliferate.The editors offered insights into the logistical considerations required for the execution of a strategic withdrawal, sometimes known by participants as a ""bug out.""  Under the sub-heading of ""The Mechanics of Withdrawal,"" the editors displayed no Order of Battle maps, nor printed any echelon of redeployments.  But the journalistic generals standing post on the 600 block of 8th Avenue in New York City did provide counsel in the military art of extracting troops and materiel from a hostile environment.The United States has about 160,000 troops and millions of tons of military gear inside Iraq.  Getting that force out safely will be a formidable challenge.  The main road south to Kuwait is notoriously vulnerable to roadside bomb attacks. Soldiers, weapons and vehicles will need to be deployed to secure bases while airlift and sealift operations are organized.  Withdrawal routes will have to be guarded. The exit must be everything the invasion was not: based on reality and backed by adequate resources.Next, versatile minds removed their Pentagon hats and donned the wingtips of Foggy Bottom as they delivered foreign policy suggestions reference consulting with Congress and nations in the region so as to minimize the impact of a U.S. departure.Although not the last paragraph, this summarized the assumptions driving the editors' opinion:The United States military cannot solve the problem.  Congress and the White House must lead an international attempt at a negotiated outcome.  To start, Washington must turn to the United Nations, which Mr. Bush spurned and ridiculed as a preface to war.  This was the collective wisdom of the New York Times editors six months ago today when they locked-and-loaded their armchairs and boldly called for the U.S. to retreat (though they avoided that word) from Iraq, and to do so without delay.  In light of what's happened in Iraq since last July 8, this saying applies to the New York Times:  Once a clock strikes thirteen, it's no longer wise to consider it an accurate source for telling time.","at0800800_6.text","Conservative",8,"at"

We live in a country where an eagle egg has more value than a human embryo.   What is left to change but the definition of marriage.  In the Scandinavian countries where gay marriage is legal there are more people living together than there are people getting married.  Is this good for the children who are born  from these unions or is a married family the best environment for a child?  Is this good change or bad change?Also there is the idea that congress should get along.   I don't think Americans realize that our founding fathers believed in the idea of checks and balances.  This is the idea that different parties bring different ideas  to the table and they fight it out till they are able to reach compromise.   Do we really want our politicians to all think alike?  Is this good change or bad change?Sen. Barack Obama attends Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago Illinois.""  The church's mission statement says that ""The fortunate who are among us combine forces with the less fortunate to become agents of change for God who is not pleased with America's economic mal-distribution"".  Another mission statement from the church says that ""We are African people, and we remain ""true to our native land"".  These statements profess a belief in wealth redistribution and allegiance to another country.  Does Senator Obama believe in these statement or not?  Is this good change or bad change?I have a slogan of my own ""where is the beef""!  Would one of these candidates please explain to me what they mean by change and how they will achieve this change.  We have not been attacked since the World Trade Center, our economy keeps ticking along and in a recent poll about 80% of American's said that they were happy with their life so what change do they want?  I guess they want slogans and soaring speeches that mean absolutely nothing.  My grandmother use to say beware of what you ask for you just might get it!Michele MitchellCasa Grande, AZ.  85222","at0800800_7.text","Conservative",8,"at"

The editorial makes clear that, in its view, upholding the law would aid the GOP, since members of communities that disproportionably vote Democratic would most likely be affected (immigrants, African-Americans, the less well-off). Yet if the Court votes against Indiana, it will be supporting the ""electoral purposes"" of another  political party, the Democratic Party. The Times yet again illustrates it is willing to throw logic overboard for political purposes. Clarice Feldman adds:Those fighting for the right of states to insist on voter identification received  a surprising piece of evidence in the very week the case was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court:WASHINGTON - On the eve of a hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Indiana Voter ID law has become a story with a twist: One of the individuals used by opponents to the law as an example of how the law hurts older Hoosiers is registered to vote in two states.

"49","Some conservatives are prematurely celebrating the death of the Big Media. Well, the BM just won the first and biggest PR battle of the election campaign, Iowa and New Hampshire. John McCain is the old love of the Left, and the Huckster is the new fave. Both will split the Republican Party, and if one of them wins, the media have saved up ammo to kill them in the Fall. So score this one Old Media 2, New Media 0. Sorry, folks. What about the Left candidates? Well, the BM have two goals: First, keeping and building their power -- which they will achieve if a Democrat wins. The second goal is their own financial viability, which they get by a horse race between Tweedle Dee Obama and Tweedle Dum Hillary. So having New Hampshire and Iowa split between the two of Left candidates serves both their economic and their ideological goal. It looks like a horse race, and they will glorify whoever wins. Total it up, and you get for New Hampshire and Iowa: Old Media 4, New Media 0. Gotta keep a honest score. The media are still the best at political manipulation. Don't count them out until they are actually out. Remember what the WaPo did to defeat Senator George Allen in Virginia: Killed him with an dumb slip of the tongue: ""macaca"". The real George Allan wouldn't know a macaca monkey from a banana split. But they provoked  him by planting an ethnic Indian guy to shadow his every move with a video cam. Allen was foolish enough to be provoked to respond with what he thought was a joke, and they Left played the video over and over again until Virginia voters were convinced that George Allen was tainted as a racist.  Since George Allen was being seen as a genuinely conservative GOP candidate with strong public appeal, the WaPo sent in its hit squad and squashed him dead. That's not a win for conservatives. No, the BM aren't dead yet. They are just transmogrifying into a different octopus. All the big web portals --- AOL, MSN, Yahoo and Google --- are owned by the Left. Newspapers may be dying, but the ideologues and manipulators of the Left are still in control. They no longer have a monopoly, but they still own most of the mind-control apparatus in America. Don't celebrate until we get a real victory.

I fear that if free and fair elections are not held it may disintegrate,” he told reporters here. He reiterated demands for a UN probe into Benazir’s assassination, explicitly casting doubt on the government’s investigation. Bilawal also criticised the US government’s support for Musharraf, AP reported. He rejected questions about the undemocratic nature of his succession, saying, “It wasn’t handed on like some piece of family furniture.” Bilawal also appealed for privacy upon his return to OxfordYoung Bilawal shows good instincts by warning of the possibility that Musharraf will pull some electoral ploy to rig the vote. He also shows good political sense by criticizing the United States - always a good move in Pakistan, one of the most anti-American countries in the world.While Musharraf has engaged Scotland Yard to help the Pakistanis get to the bottom of who killed his mother, Bilawal is clinging to the hope that the UN will get involved in the investigation. More likely, the US would veto any effort in the Security Council to set up such a body although we would probably settle for some kind of international panel to review evidence.The question some PPP members are asking is will the party leader return to Pakistan to campaign. This is not likely although his father, Asif Ali Zardari, who is running the day to day operation of the party will no doubt campaign heavily.

"53","Yesterday's big winner was ... American democracy.  Often, we forget the strength and vigor of our democracy.   Let's get some perspective.  Within the past month we have seen a former female leader of a Muslim country assassinated as she led her political party to elections in an attempt to re-establish democracy.  Benazir Bhutto herself had been accused of corruption before her exile and she knew the risks of her return.  Nevertheless, she and her followers had a powerful commitment to democracy.  Indeed, although a member of Pakistan's political elite, Bhutto positioned herself as the voice of the people.  Her supporters effectively shut down the country with rioting in the wake of her death.  Even when our national political figures have been killed, Americans response has been an outpouring of grief - both for the loss of the person and the damage done to our democratic system.In Kenya - the home country of Senator Barack Obama's father with which he maintains strong personal ties - elections were marked by corruption, which is bad enough in a democracy.  But, the popular reaction to the ""stolen election"" was telling.  Not only did the opposition's political demonstrations turn into riots, but that violence spread to the countryside and morphed into ethnically based attacks reminiscent of Rwanda. In Lebanon, Syria and its minions prevent true independence and continue to kill any political leader that might oppose its dominance.  Indeed, that country's southern area continues to be controlled by Hizbullah - a worldwide terror group backed by Syria and Iran.In America we are at the beginning of our political process, but we are witnessing a stronger-than-ever political participation.  Several strong trends among the electorate are clear even at this early stage. 1.  People want change.  Clearly, nobody in Washington heeded the voters in 2006, so they are trying to get their message through again -- in a bigger way.  Indeed, the Pelosi-Reid led Congress was remarkably tone deaf on this account.  Senator Obama, former Senator John Edwards, and former Governors Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee campaigned on the issue of change in Iowa.  By New Hampshire, Senators Hillary Clinton and John McCain had adopted this theme, as well.  Whether you believe her emotional statement or not, Sen. Clinton's moment was revealing.  She spoke to her supporters - women who came of political age in the late 1960's and early 1970's - who see Republicans as a threat to their political agenda and who want to reverse this trend before it is too late.2.  Positive outweighs negative.  People want something to believe in and vote FOR, and not simply reasons to not support a given candidate (although negative ads do work -- but they have to go all the way).  Hope may be outweighing fear in New Hampshire, at least among the independents.   Americans want to feel good about electing a president.  They are tired of holding their noses while casting their ballots.  Ronald Reagan inspired us with his vision of America as a Shining City on the Hill.  The first candidate who can create that type of positive vision for America - in speeches, advertisements and slogans - will win in November.3.  Electability will be a key message going forward.  We started to see this message in the last couple of days from the Romney and McCain campaigns.  Both claim to be able to beat Barack Obama - prior to Iowa it was Hillary.  As we move through the schedule, primary voters will increasingly be looking toward the general election and evaluating the candidates based upon electability.  We also will see this argument from the Clinton camp regarding Obama - can he beat the Republicans, or will his candidacy result in a Republican win in November.4.  Educate and cultivate your supporters -- Obama has targeted the apathetic, new and uninvolved constituencies, and has educated them about the democratic process.  Only Ron Paul uses his website to inform the public about the primary process in each state.  In both Iowa and New Hampshire people who had never participated previously did so this year.  Every four years there is a new opportunity to reach out to 18-24 year olds who have never voted for a president.  Obama does well among this constituency.  5.  Use the latest technology to create a community of supporters across the country -- both Obama and Romney continue to harness the latest technology, from video-blogs, to a social network on their websites (so supporters are not out there for the general public).  Romney's nationwide community even has its own online garage sale site so popular on the internet today.America has suffered from an appalling lack of voter participation since the end of World War II.  This election could mark a turn in the other direction.  This is good news, since it means that Americans believe that they can still change their country through the ballot box and do not have to result in other, less peaceful means.  We are not Pakistan, Kenya or Lebanon or any other country where people use violence, intimidation and corruption to gain and hold power.  We are America - the world's beacon of democracy.","at0800900_5.text","Conservative",9,"at"
"54","I am truly disappointed. By now, I expected Ron Paul to be on his way to the White House, measuring curtains for the Lincoln bedroom.At least, that was the impression left by the army of Paulbots that never tired of telling me ""Wait until Iowa"" or ""Wait until New Hampshire"" when supporters for their candidate would supposedly rise up out of the ground and march en masse to the polls, giiving their hero victory after victory.Well...we waited for Iowa. We waited for New Hampshire. My own guess is that we could wait for hell to freeze over and Ron Paul would still only be getting a fraction of the GOP vote for President. Ed Morrissey has noticed a strange phenomenon:Almost like clockwork, any time a blogger posts anything remotely critical about Ron Paul, it attracts hundreds of comments, most of them refusing to deal with the substance of the criticism. Instead, they usually contained cap-locked diatribes about the Federal Reserve, the Constitution, and how anyone who doesn't support Paul is a traitor or a fool. Many start off by saying, ""I am a Hispanic/Jewish/black voter who cares about freedom ..."" as a means of defusing the awkward inks between Paul and his newsletters and donation from neo-Nazi Don Black, as well as his 40-plus appearances on the radio show of Truther and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. But not today. It's been more than 14 hours since I posted about the TNR story, and so far ... nothing. I really expected to find scores of outraged commentary in the Disqus moderation queue when I woke up this morning, but so far, it's been as quiet as a church mouse. The results from Iowa and New Hampshire may have finally broken the spell. Paul's supporters had insisted that the Revolution would launch from Iowa and New Hampshire, but Paul only won marginal support. Even in Iowa, where he ran only against Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson -- and where his libertarianism should have won significant traction -- his campaigning left him without a single delegate to the convention. Last night's election put him behind Rudy Giuliani in fifth place, even though Giuliani didn't exactly strain himself with Granite State campaigning. The Revolution turned out to be a dud.That last is an understatement. Not only was there no ""revolution,"" there was never anything there as far as support for Paul except hot air and paranoia. Ah! Blessed silence. Hopefully, we've seen the last of those internet gangsters and can go back to rational discussion of the election rather than constantly being bombarded by the idiocies and delusions of some very strange people.","at0800900_6.text","Conservative",9,"at"

As of Tuesday night, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani had no campaign stops planned for Michigan, choosing to focus on Florida and South Carolina, but he began running TV ads in parts of the state.Democrats were forced by the national party to bypass Michigan because of the state's defiance of a rule saying they couldn't hold their primary before February 5. In addition, no delegates from Michigan will be seated at the convention. Hillary Clinton's name is on the ballot (Obamas and Edwards are not) but even if the DNC relents and allows Michigan to seat its delegation, she won't benefit from what is certain to be a landslide victory for her. The Republican National Committee also penalized Michigan but only took half their delegates away thus making Michigan a battleground between Romney and McCain. No other GOP candidate is expected to spend much time in the state with Fred Thompson and Mike Huckabee already girding themselves for a showdown in South Carolina while Rudy Giuliani is still pinning his hopes on a win in Florida.","at0800900_7.text","Conservative",9,"at"
"56","Is it ever going to be possible to have an election in this country where some idiot lefty doesn't believe that voting machines were hacked and the results tampered with?Brad Friedman of Bradblog is a dope. While professional pollsters are suprised that the results were so different than predicted, they are quietly going about the business of determining where they went wrong. They are taking a scientific approach to the problem - something that Friedman has rejected in favor of  hysteria and paranoia.Not so our intrepid lefty dolt who is trying to make the case that the counting system used by New Hampshire was using machines manufactured by the evil Diebold Corporation and therefore are automatically suspect. Diebold, you may recall, became infamous in Ohio during the 2004 election when some on the left tried to prove that the company helped Republicans steal the election. And now, apparently, the company has switched allegiances and is working for the Clintons and the Democrats:I'm not sure why Obama would have conceded so soon, given the virtually inexplicable turn of events in New Hampshire tonight. What's going on here? Before proceeding, I recommend you read the third section of the post I just ran an hour or so ago, concerning the way the ballots are counted in New Hampshire, largely on Diebold optical-scan voting systems, wholly controlled and programmed by a very very bad company named LHS Associates. Those Diebold op-scan machines are the exact same ones that were hacked in the HBO documentary, Hacking Democracy. See the previous report, as I recommend, which also includes a video of that hack, and footage of the guy who runs LHS Associates. That said, the the pre-election pollster's numbers (NOTE: that's not Exit Polls, but Pre-Election Polls!) were dead-on, for the most part, on the Republican side, as well as on the Democratic side. Except in the do-or-die (for Hillary) Clinton v. Obama race. I'm watching MSNBC right now, and they all seem to agree that the results, for the moment, defy explanation. I concur.Bradblog is no fly by night website. It is one of the top political blogs on the left. For any sane, rational person to jump to the conclusion that the vote was rigged based on absolutely no evidence whatsoever is astonishingly stupid except that evil Diebold is involved and that the pre-election polls were so wildly wrong. As for the latter, let's wait and see what the professionals come up with on why they missed the race so badly. As for the former, it is commentary like this that gives internet journalists and pundits a bad smell and denigrates the real investigative work of others.","at0800900_8.text","Conservative",9,"at"
"57","There are a lot of people who are eating some crow this morning.*  Pollsters, pundits, even professional political operatives all got it wrong in the New Hampshire Democratic primary.Hillary Clinton not only defied the odds, she defied expectations, the polls, and the prognosticators who had written her off on Monday - just 24 hours before the voting began. And the professional psephplogists who make a living analyzing and predicting elections are paying for it today with a big hit on their credibility:There will be a serious, critical look at the final pre-election polls in the Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire; that is essential. It is simply unprecedented for so many polls to have been so wrong. We need to know why. But we need to know it through careful, empirically based analysis. There will be a lot of claims about what happened - about respondents who reputedly lied, about alleged difficulties polling in biracial contests. That may be so. It also may be a smokescreen - a convenient foil for pollsters who'd rather fault their respondents than own up to other possibilities - such as their own failings in sampling and likely voter modeling. There have been previous races that misstated support for black candidates in biracial races. But most of those were long ago, and there have been plenty of polls in biracial races that were accurate. (For more on past problems with polls in biracial races, see this blog I wrote for Freakonomics last May.) And there was no overstatement of Obama in Iowa polls. On the other hand, the pre-election polls in the New Hampshire Republican race were accurate. The problem was isolated to the Democratic side - where, it should be noted, we have not just one groundbreaking candidate in Barack Obama, but also another, in Hillary Clinton. Last night's results will give ammunition to those who believe that polls are rigged or biased. There have been incidences of results-driven polls but those have always been from the public polls taken by media outlets. What made last night such a shocker was that apparently even internal polling from the campaigns got it wrong as well.Those guys make their livings off being right. They can't afford to be biased or inaccurate. So when all the polls are so far off, something else is at work, something the pollsters couldn't see and take into account.Pollster Frank Luntz said on Fox News last night that it was the turnout models that did pollsters in and that the models they are using now are ""broken"" and pollsters must go back and create models that better reflect what happened in New Hampshire. Obama (and Hillary) are apparently attracting so many new voters - and many more voters in the cumulative - that it's just too difficult to get an accurate prediction of turnout.We'll see if they can improve as we go along. But one thing is absolutely certain; neither Obama or Hillary should believe any polls they are seeing until the pollsters can prove they have a handle on the new situation.* Lest there are those of you who think I exclude myself, here's my mea culpa.","at0800900_9.text","Conservative",9,"at"
"58","Yet another media embarrassment, as the unstoppable wave of support for Obama turned out to be quite stoppable. Despite stories of hundreds of supporters bussed in from New York and Massachusetts to fill the empty rallies in New Hampshire, it appears that Hillary was able to turn out her vote better than Obama.I suspect that a monumental effort was mounted to get her voters to the polls, and the thinner ranks of the Obama organization couldn't match it. Perhaps lulled by the media's certainty of an Obama sweep, some Obama voters stayed home.I am delighted that we'll still have Hillary to discuss. I look forward to oppo research on Obama coming out. I also think the GOP remains fractured, and McCain's victory is not anything approaching a wave that sweep away the others.We have two bruising races ahead.I wrote yesterday that I wasn't buying the predictions that Hillary would drop out antyime soon. But I didn't anticipate her bounce back. Perhaps the tearing-up did help humanize her. She appears to have run very well among women, and that might be a factor.Listening to her victory speech tonight I was reminded of how unpleasant her voice is on the ears. It is simply grating. Especially when she gets excited in front of a crowd. I cannot imagine her as president.","at0800900_10.text","Conservative",9,"at"
"59","Our preoccupation with the current political scene caused many of us to overlook a tragic and noble event that took place in Iraq on January 7.According to the most detailed account, in [UK] Times Online,  It was a day of ceremony, pride and hope. Dancing Iraqi soldiers celebrated the country's national army holiday with a new chant: ""Where is terrorism today?""In the central Karrada neighbourhood, an elderly man placed flowers into the gun barrels of three recruits. And then the suicide bomber struck.Four policemen, three soldiers and four civilians were killed, and many more wounded. The death toll would have been much higher were it not for the three soldiers who threw themselves at the bomber when they became suspicious. They absorbed much of the blast. Without their action, many more would have died...The names and photos of these three heroes should have been on the front pages of all the newspapers in the world. What could be a more compelling human story? It would have been a welcome change from the too-familiar faces of the candidates. To sink momentarily into politics, these three men, by giving their lives, gave the lie to the canard, common to all the current Democratic candidates, that our involvement in Iraq has been a pointless mistake. To most or all of our politicians, the war in Iraq is merely a bargaining chip for getting votes. But to these three, it was a matter of life and death.We are justifiably proud of the valor and determination of our soldiers in Iraq. But these three Iraqi soldiers, and 135,000 others like them, had even harder choices to make with even more at stake. Unaccustomed to living in a free country, despised by many of their own people as traitors, deceived and betrayed by self-serving leaders, they nonetheless chose to risk their lives and futures for in the hope of winning lasting freedom for their families and their people. If their efforts were to fail, they and their families would become the fugitive targets of reprisals. And when the climactic moment came, they chose to give their lives to save others.And they trusted us. The Times Online article continues:The plan for US forces to hand over control of security requires huge trust on both sides, as witnessed by The Times on a joint operation. In Yusifiyah, a town in an area south of Baghdad known as the Triangle of Death, US and Iraqi troops conduct joint air assaults, patrols and other operations without any problems.Captain Michael Starz, who spends much of his time mentoring Iraqi troops, said that he had no concern about malign elements, noting that the Iraqi forces handled much of the security at a shared base where they all live on the outskirts of the town. ""Literally they have our backs and we have their backs,"" he said.Let us hope, that whatever eventually happens in Iraq, the memory of this bond of trust and mutual respect between American and Iraqi soldiers will endure.Can anyone tell me the names of these three men? I want to remember them in my prayers. And from the paradise wherein I am certain their God and mine has placed them, I hope that they will pray for you and me-pray that we not betray the trust they placed in us and in our promise of freedom.","at0801000_0.text","Conservative",10,"at"
"60","Violence continues apace in Pakistan as al-Qaeda attempts to keep the pot boiling with its signature suicide bombers wreaking havoc with civilians and military alike.The latest attack occured in Lahore was aimed directly at the judicial system:The blast in front of Lahore High Court was the latest in a wave of attacks targeting politicians and security forces ahead of Feb. 18 parliamentary elections. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion will likely fall on militants linked to Taliban and al-Qaida. It came as Scotland Yard investigators visited forensic laboratories elsewhere in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, to examine evidence in the assassination two weeks ago of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi, a city to the north. ""There were about 60 to 70 policemen on duty when a man rammed into our ranks and soon there was a huge explosion,"" said police officer Syed Imtiaz Hussain, who suffered wounds to his legs and groin. ""I saw the bodies of other policemen burning. It was like hell."" The explosion left wounded lying in pools of blood, crying for help. TV news video showed at least four mangled bodies on the ground near a destroyed motorbike and a piece of smoking debris. Ambulance workers loaded victims onto stretchers as sirens wailed.President Pervez Musharraf continued to put up a brave front, saying that he would ""continue the fight against terrorism and extremism and not to be deterred by such acts,"" but there is a sense that the situation is spinning out of control. There have been 20 suicide attacks in the last few months that have killed more than 400 people in Pakistan.","at0801000_1.text","Conservative",10,"at"
"61","As explained  by Ray Robison  on these pages, Coalition forces in Pakistan have been splitting Al Qaeda from local tribes, much as AQ has been isolated from its local support in Iraq, with tribal leaders turning against it. Now it appears that this move is bearing publicly-visible fruit.Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reports:  WANA, Jan 9: Thousands of armed tribesmen of South Waziristan met here on Wednesday, vowing to organise a Lashkar to hunt down Al Qaeda-linked militants blamed for killing nine of their kinsmen.The tribal jirga in Wana came three days after militants stormed two offices and killed nine tribal elders of a government-sponsored peace committee.The jirga ordered tribesmen from every household belonging to the Wazir tribe to come to Wana with arms to prepare for action, a local official said.""One man from each house should come to Wana with a gun at 10am on Thursday to plan our defence and act against those who are responsible for disorder,"" tribal chief Malik Ghaffar told the gathering.Wazir tribe chief Maulvi Nazir, who earned fame after he drove out hundreds of Uzbeks from the region last year in bloody clashes, is expected to address the Lashkar on Thursday.He did not turn up at Wednesday's meeting but had earlier blamed Baitullah Mehsud, a local Al Qaeda commander and leader of the rival Mehsud tribe, for the killing of the peace committee members.This represents another triumph for our War on Terror strategy. It didn't just happen. It is the product of a complex series of moves. Note that while Pakistan's President Musharraf may be cooperating with this tribal initiative, it is not a political initiative of the government. Indeed, the limited ability of the formal government of Pakistan to control this territory has been an obstacle in the past.Hat tip: The Astute Blogger Update:  Andrew Bostom writes:Here is a sobering/depressing counterpoint from a reporter:*Not surprisingly, many Punjabis are now openly voicing the fear if the deteriorating situation in the Pashtun belt (NWFP and the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan) is not arrested and reversed fast, the frontier would be lost. And if the frontier is lost, then Baluchistan, too, would break away from Pakistan. This anecdote was especially depressing:According to another Pashtun journalist, who has been reporting the Islamist insurgency from ground-zero, there have been many desertions from the paramilitary forces (the Frontier Corp and Tribal Levies). He spoke about a friend of his who quit the tribal levies because he was warned by his father that if he died fighting the Taliban, let alone getting a burial, even his body will not be permitted to enter the village. *Thanks to Laurie Mylroie for pointing out that the reporter is an Indian, not a Pakistani, as previously reported.Update: Ray Robison writes:I actually don’t see that as a counter point but as a consequence. I predicted there was essentially going to be a Taliban civil war. So yeah, it’s gonna get messy in the administered areas, but that is what we WANT to happen. Musharraf (and the US) doesn’t need to send in forces to kill the Taliban if they are killing each other. The Pakistan government will not fall over this, though thhave a rough time ahead. It may even move the military and the democrats closer together.","at0801000_2.text","Conservative",10,"at"
"62","Senator John Kerry will endorse Barack Obama sources close to the Senator have told numerous media outlets.No word on how John Edwards, Kerry's 2004 running mate is taking the news, but if I were his staff, I'd keep all sharp objects out of his reach for a while:Kerry is flying to South Carolina for an event to be held shortly after 11 a.m. in Charleston, the sources said. Obama is holding a ""Rally for Change"" at the College of Charleston ahead of the Democrats' South Carolina primary on Jan. 26. Kerry's endorsement message will focus on Obama's ability to bring the country transformational change, the sources said. The endorsement also represents a sharp elbow at former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who was Kerry's running mate in 2004 and also a South Carolina native. Kerry, who had contemplated another run of his own this year, remains one of the Democratic Party's most popular figures, and gives Obama a big boost as he is trying to regain his momentum after finishing second to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. Hillary was never in the running since the Clinton machine put so much pressure on him last year to stay out of the race. I'm sure there's a barrelful of resentment and it is probably giving Kerry a lot of pleasure to stick it to Hillary. What about his former running mate Edwards?

"63","It seems that Hillary Clinton Campaign's recently use of the racially charged term ""spadework"" on the Today Show in referring to Sen. Obama was not a one time event.   Back on July 24, 2007, the Clinton campaign attacked Sen. Obama for his remarks during a debate where he stated he would be willing to meet with leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea. In a post-debate rebuttal of Sen. Obama, reported by CBS, a member of Sen. Clinton's inner circle had this to say: ""I would think that without having done the diplomatic spadework, it would not really prove anything,"" former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a conference call with reporters set up by the Clinton campaign. Hillary has been said to have a political ""tin ear"" earlier in this campaign, but she and her senior people chose their words very carefully, particularly in press releases and television appearances. This was an obvious unvarnished racial message, insulting an accomplished black man. The repeated use of it is not a coincidence. So much for gratefulness for years of black voter loyalty. I believe it was Brent Scowcroft who paraphrased Oscar Wilde by stating that, in politics, a friend is someone who stabs you in the front. The African-American community has just been stabbed in the front twice by the wife of ""the first black president."" I would propose Sen. Clinton can make amends for this breach of faith with the black community in only one way: an affirmative action set-aside. In keeping with Democratic party ideals and practices, Sen. Clinton should step aside and let Sen. Obama have her delegates. After all, the Democratic Party asks white firefighters and bank clerks to step aside for affirmative action to make up for hundreds of years of slavery and Jim Crow Laws, and those regular working people haven't insulted anyone in the press by making racially charged references to ""spadework."" It is only fair (no, I'm not auditioning as a Democrat speechwriter) and justice will only be served if Sen. Clinton resigns from the presidential primaries now. She owes it the people who have loyally supported her party for so many years in their struggle for equality. They deserve a chance at the brass ring.  What I just suggested will obviously not likely happen. However, as Sen. Clinton keeps aggressively attacking Sen. Obama, in ways considered by the public both fair and not so fair - and if she wins the nomination - a significant number of black people just may decide that they have better places for their hand on November 4th than on the Hillary Clinton lever in a voting booth.(Jack Kemp is not the politician of the same name.)","at0801000_4.text","Conservative",10,"at"
"64","Michigan's January 15th Democratic primary is meaningless at the moment thanks to sanctions put in place by the Democratic National Committee that denies any delegates to the state because they violated party rules and held their nominating contest prior to February 5.(Note: The GOP sanctions on the state took only half the delegates from the state's total to be seated at the convention).In fact, the DNC forbade any candidates from campaigning in the state or even being on the ballot (similar sanctions were leveled against Florida and three other states). But somehow, Hillary Clinton, Mike Gravel, and Dennis Kucinich are still on the ballot thanks to their refusal to remove their names once the paperwork had gone through.Now there's a move on among Michigan Democrats to have people vote ""uncomitted"" on the primary ballot while the state tries to change the mind of the DNC about not seating any delegates:U.S. Sen. Carl Levin and state Democratic Party Chair Mark Brewer said Michigan Dems can still have an indirect say in the nominating process if they check the ""uncommitted"" box on the ballot. State law prohibits write-ins for candidates who have not authorized write-in campaigns; Obama, Edwards and Richardson have not. If ""uncommitted"" draws at least 15 percent of the vote in a congressional district, delegates not bound to any candidate could be sent to the national convention, possibly enabling Obama and Edwards supporters to play a role in the nomination. ""You can't afford not to vote in Michigan,"" Levin said. ""It's critically important to vote to have impact on the delegates going to (the national party convention)."" Michigan campaign teams for Obama and Edwards are actively urging their supporters to vote ""uncommitted,"" Brewer said. Brewer is officially neutral in the presidential race, but he's long been a friend of labor, which generally has been supportive of Edwards in Michigan. Nationally, labor endorsements have been split. Will both the GOP and Democrats risk alienating voters in Michigan and Florida - two of t he ten largest states in the Union - by continuing the sanctions? No one knows which is why this is probably a good move by Michigan Democrats. But party rules forbid any kind of appeal - except on the convention floor. And that might be one interesting floor fight if Hillary wins the popular vote but many ""uncommitted"" delegates show up at the convention.","at0801000_5.text","Conservative",10,"at"
"65","Philip Agee, former CIA case officer and traitor to America died yesterday in Havana. Agee outed dozens of CIA agents and covert operations in the 1970's, earning high praise from the left at the time and leading to the passage of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 - a controversial measure rabidly opposed by liberals in the United States.In a flip flop, the left then embraced the act in order to prosecute Scooter Libby. We don't know where they will be tomorrow on the issue but that's OK - they don't either. Although it was never proven, it is believed that Agee was responsible for the death of the Athens station chief for the CIA. In fact, Agee fought most of the last year's of his life to have any mention of that incident stricken from the public record, going to his grave saying he had nothing to do with the operative's death. Many think otherwise.Here's an excerpt from this somewhat misleading obit in the New York Times:  Despite its political viewpoint, “CIA Diary” is considered by some agency veterans to offer an accurate account of the work of a case officer. In a talk at Harvard last year, Michael Sulick, now head of the C.I.A.’s clandestine service, recommended Mr. Agee’s book as “an excellent reflection of the day-to-day life of an officer, until he starts going bad, and then of course it’s totally untrue.” Oleg D. Kalugin, a former K.G.B. general who now lives outside Washington, said Mr. Agee approached Soviet intelligence in Mexico in the early 1970s but was rejected by an officer who thought he was a plant. He then approached Cuban intelligence, supplying details of C.I.A. operations in Latin America that were passed on to the K.G.B. “He was a valuable source,” Mr. Kalugin said.To this day. many on the left consider this ""valuable source"" for the old Soviet Union an American hero.

"68","American Thinker has been documenting the strange campaign of Ron Paul for months. Most notably, Andrew Walden has delved into the Texas Congressman's acceptance of funds from neo-Nazis and other troubling aspects of his campaign in several articles.Now one of Paul's staunchest defenders, Matt Welch of Reason Magazine, has dug deeply and discovered that Ron Paul is indeed, a racist.Here is Ron Paul yesterday on CNN talking about newsletters published for 17 years under his name that carry numerous examples of the most nauseating kind of blatant racism imgaginable:Paul told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" Thursday that he didn't write any of the offensive articles and has ""no idea"" who did.  ""When you bring this question up, you're really saying, 'You're a racist' or 'Are you a racist?' And the answer is, 'No, I'm not a racist,'"" he said. [snip] Paul said the editor of publications ""is responsible for daily activities."" But he also cited ""transition"" and ""changes"" and said that some people were hired to write stories ""but I didn't know their names."" The presidential hopeful described the newsletter revelations as a ""rehash"" of old material dug up by his opponents because he is gaining ground with black voters due to his stance against the war in Iraq and the war on drugs. ""I am the anti-racist because I am the only candidate -- Republican or Democrat -- who would protect the minority against these vicious drug laws,"" he said. ""Libertarians are incapable of being a racist, because racism is a collectivist idea."" To sum up, Paul said he didn't know who wrote the articles and didn't write any of them himself. He says the sentiments are not his own and that the newsletters are just a ""rehash"" of old charges made against him. To put it as succinctly as I can, Ron Paul is a lying racist. Here's what Reason Magazine's Matt Welch -- formerly one of Paul's biggest supporters -- found out about Paul and those newsletters when doing a Lexis-Nexis search: Has Paul really disassociated himself from, and ""taken moral responsibility"" for, these ""Ron Paul"" newsletters ""for over a decade""? If he has, that history has not been recorded by the Nexis database, as best as I can reckon. The first indication I could find of Paul either expressing remorse about the statements or claiming that he did not author them came in an October 2001 Texas Monthly article -- less than eight years ago. [snip] So what exactly did Paul and his campaign say about these and more egregious statements during his contentious 1996 campaign for Congress, when Democrat Lefty Morris made the newsletters a constant issue? Besides complaining that the quotes were taken ""out of context"" and proof of his opponent's ""race-baiting,"" Paul and his campaign defended and took full ownership of the comments.Indeed, Paul even said back in 1996 that he actually wrote some of the newsletters. This is from a Dallas Morning News article from 1996 found by Welch: Dr. Paul denied suggestions that he was a racist and said he was not evoking stereotypes when he wrote the columns. He said they should be read and quoted in their entirety to avoid misrepresentation. [...] In the interview, he did not deny he made the statement about the swiftness of black men. ""If you try to catch someone that has stolen a purse from you, there is no chance to catch them,"" Dr. Paul said.""Them"" meaning those skittery black folk. BTW - I would mention to Paul supporters that stereotyping is racism - period. No excuses. No apologia will change that stark, singular fact. CNN has more evidence of Paul's duplicity on the subject of the newsletters: The controversial newsletters include rants against the Israeli lobby, gays, AIDS victims and Martin Luther King Jr. -- described as a ""pro-Communist philanderer."" One newsletter, from June 1992, right after the LA riots, says ""order was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks."" Another says, ""The criminals who terrorize our cities -- in riots and on every non-riot day -- are not exclusively young black males, but they largely are. As children, they are trained to hate whites, to believe that white oppression is responsible for all black ills, to 'fight the power,' to steal and loot as much money from the white enemy as possible."" In some excerpts, the reader may be led to believe the words are indeed from Paul, a resident of Lake Jackson, Texas. In the ""Ron Paul Political Report"" from October 1992, the writer describes carjacking as the ""hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos."" The author then offers advice from others on how to avoid being carjacked, including ""an ex-cop I know,"" and says, ""I frankly don't know what to make of such advice, but even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, I've urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. For the animals are coming.""Ron Paul lied when he said he didn't write some of the newsletters. He lied when he said they didn't reflect his thinking when clearly they did. And he lied when he said he didn't know who wrote some of the newsletters.Ed Morrissey, from whose blogpost many of these excerpts have been taken, sums it up nicely:People wonder why this matters, given Paul's fringe appeal. It matters because we can't allow this kind of hatred to get legitimized in mainstream politics again. This kind of rhetoric used to be mainstream, and not just in the South, either. Republicans cannot allow the party to get tainted by the stench of racism and conspiracy mongering. If enough of us don't step up and denounce it, strongly and repeatedly, we will not be able to avoid it. Matt Welch and the people at Reason have reached that same conclusion in regards to libertarianism and their magazine. Good for them, even if it came a little late.His supporters, blinded by a zealotry that is now even more impossible to understand, have not been affected by these revelations in the slightest. But we at American Thinker have been deeply troubled by elements seemingly welcomed into Dr. Paul's campaign. It has cost us much in the way of hate mail and sneering, self righteous pablum from Paulbots. My question to them is very simple; how can you in good conscience continue to support the candidacy of this racist, anti-Semitic crank?","at0801100_0.text","Conservative",11,"at"

Reporter Felicity Barranger interviewed Joseph yesterday and wrote this about our role:The broader stir on the Internet began when Joseph Somsel, a San Jose-based contributor to the publication American Thinker, wrote an article a week ago on the programmable communicating thermostat, or P.C.T.Mr. Somsel went after the proposal with arguments that were by turns populist (""Come the next heat wave, the elites might be comfortably lolling in La Jolla's ocean breezes"" while ""the Central Valley's poor peons are baking in Bakersfield""), free-market (""P.C.T.'s will obscure the price signals to power plant developers"") and civil libertarian (""the new P.C.T. requirement certainly seems to violate the ‘a man's home is his castle' common-law dictum"").Word of the California proposal hit the outrage button in corners of the Internet, was written about in The North County Times in Southern California, and got a derisive mention on Wednesday on Rush Limbaugh's radio program. The fact that similar radio-controlled technologies have been used on a voluntary basis in irrigation systems on farm fields and golf courses and in limited programs for buildings on Long Island is seldom mentioned in Internet postings that make liberal use of references of George Orwell's dystopian novel ""1984"" and ""Big Brother,"" the omnipresent voice of Orwell's police state.Sweetness & Light detected a certain snark factor in the article. Read the article, the critique, and make up your own mind. I would simply note that calling us a ""publication"" is a step up from the last time the NYT took note of American Thinker and called us ""a conservative blog run by a Berkeley management consultant.""One of the big three broadcast networks is preparing a story on the issue, and is arranging an interview with Joseph Somsel. Stay tuned for more developments as the MSM catches up with developments you first read about here.","at0801100_1.text","Conservative",11,"at"
"70","Dennis Kucinich, a candidate for president who claims to have seen a UFO when at Shirely McLain's house, is demanding that there be a recount of votes in New Hampshire:Democrat Dennis Kucinich, who won less than 2 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, said Thursday he wants a recount to ensure that all ballots in his party's contest were counted. The Ohio congressman cited ""serious and credible reports, allegations and rumors"" about the integrity of Tuesday results. Deputy Secretary of State David Scanlan said Kucinich is entitled to a statewide recount. But, under New Hampshire law, Kucinich will have to pay for it. Scanlan said he had ""every confidence"" the results are accurate. In a letter dated Thursday, Kucinich said he does not expect significant changes in his vote total, but wants assurance that ""100 percent of the voters had 100 percent of their votes counted."" Kucinich alluded to online reports alleging disparities around the state between hand-counted ballots, which tended to favor Sen. Barack Obama, and machine-counted ones that tended to favor Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. He also noted the difference between pre-election polls, which indicated Obama would win, and Clinton's triumph by a 39 percent to 37 percent margin.Kucinich is seeing things again: Scanlon said his office had received several phone calls since Tuesday, mostly from outside the state, questioning the results. New Hampshire's voting machines are not linked in any way, which Scanlon says reduce the likelihood of tampering with results on a statewide level. Also, the results can be checked against paper ballots.Much of the paranoia coming from the left is out of sheer ignorance. Polls, of course, are not predictive. Polls are snapshots of a given moment in time. In the case of the polls before New Hampshire, the last one was completed on Monday afternoon - before the impact of Hillary Clinton's emotional moment had time to become the factor that it eventually became. That moment galvanized the women's vote as fully 57% of all Democratic primary voters ended up being women - a spectacular and unprecedented number. The fact that a hacker would have to get in to several hundred individual machines to change the vote makes the conspiracy theories surrounding the count absurd on their face. But don't tell the Paulbots or the far left fringe of the Democratic party. They are both much more comfortable living in their own little paranoid fantasy where the world is against them and evil stalks the land.","at0801100_2.text","Conservative",11,"at"
"71","The report yesterday of Iraqi soldiers sacrificing their lives by throwing themselves at a terror bomber and saving lives of their colleagues and civilians reminded me of an event last year  involving a Concerned Local Citizens group (CLC) member who sacrificed himself to save American and Iraqi lives.  Here is the story from the MNF-Iraq website:August 21, 2007Citizen sacrifices life to thwart suicide bomber Multi-National Division - Center PAOFORWARD OPERATING BASE HAMMER, Iraq - An Iraqi man saved the lives of four U.S. Soldiers and eight civilians when he intercepted a suicide bomber during a Concerned Citizens meeting in the town of al-Arafia Aug. 18.  The incident occurred while Soldiers from 3rd Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, were talking with members of the al-Arafia Concerned Citizens, a volunteer community group, at a member's house. ""I was about 12 feet away when the bomber came around the corner,"" said Staff Sgt. Sean Kane, of Los Altos, Calif., acting platoon sergeant of Troop B, 3-1 Cav.  ""I was about to engage when he jumped in front of us and intercepted the bomber as he ran toward us. As he pushed him away, the bomb went off."" The citizen's actions saved the lives of four U.S. Soldiers and eight civilians. Kane felt the loss personally because he had met and interacted with his rescuer many times before the incident. ""He was high-spirited and really believed what the group (Concerned Citizens) was doing,"" Kane said. ""I have no doubt the bomber was trying to kill American Soldiers. It was very calculated the way the bomber tried to do it. If he hadn't intercepted him, there is no telling how bad it could have been."" Kane believes the citizen is a hero. ""He could have run behind us or away from us, but he made the decision to sacrifice himself to protect everyone. Having talked with his father, I was told that even if he would have known the outcome before hand, he wouldn't have acted differently."" Capt. Brian Gilbert, of Boise, Idaho, the commander of Company D, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, currently attached to 3-1 Cavalry, echoed Kane's sentiment. ""I spoke with the father,"" Gilbert said. ""He said he has no remorse in his son's death because he died saving American Soldiers.""","at0801100_3.text","Conservative",11,"at"
"72","Scott Johnson of Powerline offers two outstanding commentaries on Israel-related matters.He first noted yesterday the puzzling (at best; shameful at worst) rhetoric President Bush used yesterday in speaking of a Palestinian state.The devolution of President Bush's foreign policy is vividly on display on his trip to Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In the case of North Korea, Iran, and Israel, the arc of Bush foreign policy has become Clintonian, predicated on empty words and meaningless gestures. I tried to point out one aspect of this devolution in ""When words lose their meaning,"" noting President Bush's silent abandonment of the critieria he himself had articulated for attendeance at the Annapolis peace conference. Did anyone notice? As he urges Palestinian statehood, President Bush continues to assert despite appearances to the contrary that President Abbas and the Arabs within the Palestinian Authority understand the importance of ""democratic states living side by side in peace."" The rise of Hamas would seem to suggest otherwise. The fact that Hamas has seized control of territory within the nascent Palestinian state presents something of a problem (as does the continuing terrorism wrought by Fatah and other forces operating on the West Bank). Here is how President Bush put it yesterday in his press conference with the nominal leader of the Palestinian Authority, the gentleman who still sports a nom de guerre: Separately, Scott notes today that Ms. Magazine has rejected an innocuous ad noting the prominent role of women in Israeli public life:The American Jewish Congress submitted this understated advertisement about the status of women in Israel to Ms. Magazine. Underneath the attractive photographs of Israel's foreign minister (Tzipi Livni), Supreme Court president (Dorit Beinish), and speaker of the Knesset (Dalia Itzik), the ad reads: ""This is Israel."" I think it is fair to say that in most parts of the United States it would be deemed an utterly innocuous ad.Ms. rejected the ad. Yesterday the AJC issued this press release with the following comments: ""What other conclusion can we reach,"" asked Richard Gordon, President of AJCongress, ""except that the publishers -- and if the publishers are right, a significant number of Ms. Magazine readers -- are so hostile to Israel that they do not even want to see an ad that says something positive about Israel?""Both commentaries deserve to be read in full. And Scott Johnson deserves our admiration, something he and his Powerline colleagues have long had.Hat tip: Dennis Sevakis and Clarice FeldmanUpdate: Bob Teter writes:I read about this in a news item yesterday. Bush also mentioned the Palestinian state must be contiguous(!). Olmert suggests giving away part of Jerusalem. This is disheartening rhetoric. There is no 'Mid East Peace Process' . What there is has to be the most perverse assymetrical war in the history of the planet. A war where one side actually funds it's enemy! And  Bush has fallen into the footsteps of the politicians that preceded him, blithely pursuing a policy that has nothing to do with the real world. If this is the best he can do, he would be ahead to just shut up and wait for his  term to end.","at0801100_4.text","Conservative",11,"at"
"73","The stakes are high in Nevada for the Democrats who will Caucus on January 19th to determine who wins the bulk of the state's 33 delegates. Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have been working the state for months, piling up endorsements and saturating the air waves with ads.Clinton has the support of most of the Democratic establishment. Obama just received the endorsement of the most powerful union in the state - the 60,000 Culinary Workers Union. And both canddates plan to spend plenty of time in the state before the voting:But Clinton is in the final heat of an intense race for the Democratic nomination, and Nevada, which holds the Democrats' next contest, on Jan. 19, is ground zero for that cold, hard fight. After leaving the Santanas' house, Clinton walked across the street and took questions from a few of the dozens of reporters, standing in front of a faded American flag pinned to a dingy garage door. Today, Clinton is scheduled to travel to Los Angeles, where she will give a policy speech about the economy and what kind of stimulus she believes it needs. ""I think we're slipping toward a recession,"" she said. ""A couple of people that I met on the street, they work in construction. They tell me it's slowed down."" She reiterated her doubts about the caucus process, which requires in-person, on-time participation. ""That is troubling to me,"" she said. ""People who work during that amount of time, they're disenfranchised. People who can't be in the state or are in the military, they cannot be present. ... If people feel like there's no reason to participate or they can't, then that's the same thing. So I think it's a problem."" Clinton and her busload of traveling press moved from there to the popular local Mexican restaurant Lindo Michoacan, where a ""roundtable"" that was actually square passed a microphone around to tell her people's concerns about the mortgage crisis and foreclosures. She took notes and munched on tortilla chips. In broken English, one woman told Clinton how she wasn't making money as a broker anymore. ""I have no income at all,"" she said. ""So how will I survive?"" Choking up with emotion, the woman said, ""In my neighborhood, there are brand-new homes, but the value is nothing. I'm glad you are here so I can tell you, because you're going to be the president, I know."" A man shouted through an opening in the wall that his wife was illegal. ""No woman is illegal,"" Clinton said, to cheers.There is a large Hispanic vote in Nevada and the state has been trending toward the Democrats in recent elections. While much of the state is considered conservative, Clark County (Las Vegas) comprises about 50% of the population and is heavily Democratic. The faster Las Vegas has grown, the more Democratic the state has become. Unions also play a large role in politics - something of an anomaly out west. So with Obama's endorsement by the Culinary workers, it is thought he may have a leg up on the former First Lady when Nevadans go to their Caucus sites.","at0801100_5.text","Conservative",11,"at"

A Justice Department audit released Thursday blamed the lost connections on the FBI's lax oversight of money used in undercover investigations. In one office alone, unpaid costs for wiretaps from one phone company totaled $66,000.In at least one case, a wiretap used in a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act investigation ""was halted due to untimely payment,"" the audit found. FISA wiretaps are used in the government's most sensitive and secretive criminal and intelligence investigations, and allow eavesdropping on suspected terrorists or spies.""We also found that late payments have resulted in telecommunications carriers actually disconnecting phone lines established to deliver surveillance results to the FBI, resulting in lost evidence,"" according to the audit by Inspector General Glenn A. Fine.More than half of 990 bills to pay for telecommunication surveillance in five unidentified FBI field offices were not paid on time, the report shows.FBI--pay the phone bills, pay the late charges, properly vet and prosecute those who steal funds which partially  caused this disgraceful mess, follow the recommended improvements and protect our citizens and our country.  That isn't asking too much, is it?","at0801100_6.text","Conservative",11,"at"

The NRA writes:In 2005, NRA sought an injunction against the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to prevent them from enacting one of the nation's most restrictive gun bans. NRA won the injunction, but the City's mayor and Board of Supervisors ignored the court order and approved a set of penalties, including a $1,000 fine and a jail term of between 90 days and six months, for city residents who own firearms for lawful purposes in their own homes. ""We promised our California NRA members in 2005 that we would fight any gun ban instituted by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and we haven't given up that fight,"" continued Cox.

"76","Open tribal warfare in remote areas of Pakistan has the potential of scoring a major success in the War on Terror. As pointed out here at AT yesterday, indicators point to the beginning of the civil war between Taliban tribes predicted here at the American Thinker. Two prominent leaders, Taliban chiefs find themselves at bloody conflict instigated by al Qaeda operators. The fault line between al Qaeda allied Taliban and MMA/Musharraf allied Taliban has ruptured.While the outward appearance of a civil war may be gloomy on purely humanistic terms, it is a positive development when viewed for what it is: our enemies killing each other off. If we look a little bit down the road, we can see the pros and cons. On the down side, innocent civilians will, as always, bear the brunt of the factional violence. However, the civilians in the tribal regions are largely responsible for the success of the Taliban and al Qaeda in launching terrorists attacks on us. They provide support, hide them, nurture the wounded Taliban and al Qaeda. Some of them are the families of the Taliban. While it would be better to subdue the Taliban without military might, this is the condition they have created, and it is now going to strike home for them. The civil war in the restive areas of Pakistan will likely spill over into the calm regions. But even that may have a positive result. While the road ahead will be challenging for the Musharraf government, the specter of Islamic jihadis shooting it out and blowing each other up in the streets of major cities just might lead the democratic reform movement to stand by Musharraf, at least until the threat subsides. Such an alliance was already underway at US urging when Benazir Bhutto bailed on the agreement and started bashing Musharraf openly.In addition, the powerful MMA, Pakistan's jihad-centric political movement, which has made only token complaint about the army campaign against ""the brothers"" routed from the Swat valley region, will have even more incentive to actively assist Musharraf. If al Qaeda actually took over the Pakistan government (which is a very low probability) the MMA leaders, especially Maulana Fazlur Rahman could expect to be executed right alongside the military rulers.This ""Taliban split"" strategy is indeed high risk, and the potential consequences of failure are frightening. But the payoff is huge. The ""anti-al Qaeda"" Taliban tribes (and don't confuse this as friendly to the US) will find themselves in need of help. When they do, they will turn to Musharraf. He in turn will come to the US. Of course, this kind of assistance will be covert, until it shows up on the front page of the New York Times anyway.When that happens, we get to make demands. I would not be surprised if an essential criterion for assistance will be a requirement to track down and turn over core al Qaeda leadership. If/when that happens, they may hand over Zawahiri (though I doubt we will ever get Usama bin Laden) or at least flush him out for us to get him.All this will be enabled because Musharraf will have justification, within his own government and with the MMA, to apply full pressure in the tribal areas. The hands-off approach of the past is at an end.This could lead to a dissociated tribal region. However, I don't really see how it could get much more detached from the Pakistani government anyway.And most beneficial to our cause is that the strategic focus of al Qaeda and the allied Taliban will come off of Afghanistan and become the Pakistan tribal areas. This will ease the fighting for our coalition forces just like this rift helped to ease the conflict in Iraq when al Qaeda forces were redeployed to the tribal regions from Iraq. The end state I predict by the end of the year is a serious reduction of the power of the jihad block in Pakistan as it tears itself apart, a strong alliance among the democratic reformers and the military block, the serious reduction of the Afghanistan conflict (after an up tick possibly) and the capture of at least a few core al Qaeda leaders.Ray Robison is the co-author of Both in One Trench.","at0801100_8.text","Conservative",11,"at"
"77","That's the question asked by Ed Morrissey and many Republicans following last night's GOP debate in South Carolina.Mitt Romney took on Senator John McCain, the victor in New Hampshire, over economic issues in an effort to sway voters in Michigan before its primary on Tuesday. Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Thompson tussled over South Carolina voters. And Rudolph W. Giuliani took a muted swipe at Mr. McCain in an effort to win over security-minded voters before the Jan. 29 Florida primary. But it was Mr. Thompson’s performance, in which he shook off the laid-back style that has defined his candidacy, that provided some of the liveliest moments of the debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C.. “This is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party and its future,” said Mr. Thompson, who has staked his run on a strong showing in South Carolina. The primary there is Jan. 19. “On the one hand,” he said, “you have the Reagan revolution, you have the Reagan coalition of limited government and strong national security. And the other hand, you have the direction that Governor Huckabee would take us in. He would be a Christian leader, but he would also bring about liberal economic policies, liberal foreign policies.”Thompson was a one man wrecking crew, carving up Mike Huckabee and to a certain extent Mitt Romney, calling them out for claiming to be something they are not; legitimate conservatives. The candidate most often accused of lacking energy and excitement was on the attack all night, delivering a passionate defense of the Reagan coalition and conservative pricnicples while displaying a sound and supple grasp of foreign affairs.By all media accounts as well as according to the Fox News focus group following the debate, it was by far and away Fred Thompson's night.But while giving him the laurels for the debate, that same focus group highlighted Thompson's huge problem in South Carolina - many do not think he is electable and that this show of strength may be too late.Meanwhile, Mitt Romney may be considered the biggest loser last night. Before the South Carolina primary, there is the Michigan primary - a very important test for Mr. Romney who was born in Michigan and whose father was a former governor. On that battleground, his main opponent in John McCain, a man who won that primary in 2000 and who is expected to do well because independents and Democrats can cross over and vote in the GOP race.Given all of that, Romney failed to make much of a dent against McCain last night when he had the opportunity. In that sense, he failed to knock McCain down a bit before the voting in Michigan next Tuesday.John McCain had one of his better debates, especially when talking about foreign policy and his record as a fiscal conservative.Mike Huckabee was busy fending off attacks from most of the other candidates but managed a couple of solid answers on religion and the economy.  Rudy Giuliani appeared in the background at times and does not seem as forceful or confident as he did in other debates.No questions to Ron Paul about the racist newsletters put out in his name for 17 years. Nevertheless, Mr. Paul won the Fox News text messaging viewer poll after the debate when his minions spammed the contest. No doubt a great win for the Texas Congressman who is an embarrassment to the Republican party thanks to the revelations about the nauseating material that went out in his name for so many years.","at0801100_9.text","Conservative",11,"at"

"79","Andrew Bostom raises his eyebrows over a scandal in the world of Koranic scholarship. A priceless archive of photographs of early Koran manuscripts was claimed to have been destroyed in bombing of the Bavarian Academy of Science. This was a lie perpetrated by ""a powerful figure in postwar German scholarship"" according this account  by Andrew Higgins in the Wall Street Journal. Anton Spitaler, an Arabic scholar at the academy, hid the 250 rolls of film away for decades. Higgins' Journal story focuses on Spitaler's former student, Angelika Neuwirth, now a professor at the Free University of Berlin. Neuwirth aknowledges their existence and is leading a ""renewal"" of Koranic studies, with state funding for her team for 18 years, expecting to take much longer to produce results. But rather than applaud the new venture Andrew Bostom points out: …in effect Neuwirth has likely DENIED serious scholars access to this material for 20 years.He cites a footnote in an essay by by Dr. Gerd Puin on p. 743 of Ibn Warraq's 2002 book What The Koran Really Says:  Angelika Neuwirth has given the impression the photographs taken in order to build up the ""Koran Archiv"" in Munich...  were destroyed at the end of World War II. This impression is false, and thus it is an amazing fact that evidently no attempt has been made since to study the photographs! Whatever the ethics of Spitaler and Neuwirth keeping the manuscript copies secret, she has them now and her team will take its time. Neuwirth's team will producethe first ""critical edition"" of the Quran -- an attempt to divine what the original text looked like and to explore overlaps with the Bible and other Christian and Jewish literature.It is clear that this sort of scholarship is risky. Anything challenging the legitimacy of various Koranic passages has political meaning, and risks the ire of fanatics. The Journal deadpans:Applying Western critical methods to Islam's holiest text is a sensitive test of the Muslim community's readiness to both accommodate and absorb thinking outside its own traditionsEver since the 19th Century, Muslims resented Germanic scholarship on the Koran and other saced documents, raising questions about accepted texts:During the 19th century, Germans pioneered modern scholarship of ancient texts. Their work revolutionized understanding of Christian and Jewish scripture. It also infuriated some of the devout, who resented secular scrutiny of texts believed to contain sacred truths.Keeping the manuscripts apparently out of the public domain and in the hands of what amount to German civil servants for decades, this may be a step forward from secrecy and lies, but it is very far from open scholarship.And that is the huge difference between Islam and the other major faiths. Fanatics willing to kill do not want to allow open scrutiny of the faith.","at0801200_0.text","Conservative",12,"at"
"80","Christopher Hitchens has always been a puzzle and delight to me. He brings equal passion to being appalled by Bill Clinton and Mother Teresa, an odd coupling, and is always eloquent and funny, even when dead wrong. A legendary drinker and smoker, he has always struck me as a man whose use of nicotine and alcohol, the traditional lubricants (and devils) of literary genius, was integral to the productive, free-wheeling state of mind he must maintain. Alcohol lowers assorted kinds of barriers, while nicotine sharpens certain faculties. Both substances can be addictive and harmful, but some believe them almost necessary to the occupation. Which is not to say that observant Mormons can't be literary geniuses. Not everyone needs to drink and smoke to be a great wit. However there is a category of human beings who are funnier, more free-wheeling and in some ways faster, with a drink and a smoke, or (depending on the setting) chaw, dip, or a little snuff up the nose. These days there is even the Patch.So it is with a certain shock that I learn from Edward Luce of the Financial Times that Hitch has given up smoking. In the course of a description of a long lunch at a restaurant specififcally chosen because outdoor tables allow smoking, Luce learns Hitch has stopped, quoting him:""I've tried many different methods over the last few months -- everything, absolutely everything; therapy sessions, various classes and groups -- none of them worked at all,"" Hitchens continues, oblivious to what he has unleashed. ""Then I woke up yesterday and said: ‘Enough.' By the way, don't let me stop you from smoking,"" he adds airily. ""Doesn't bother me. I feel no temptation at all."" And so the meal begins with a unilateral cigarette.Of course, I do want the best for Mr. Hitchens, and hope to enjoy his wit for as long as possible. I should hope Hitch would do what is best for his health. And a big part of me is very happy that he has made this important choice and seems set on succeeding.But I can't help wondering if altering his blood chemistry will affect Hitch's thinking and productivity. After all, there is a delicate balance between the stimulative and depressive elements of the two drugs. Will Hitch lose his edge? A friend of mine is currently about a month into kicking the habit, and she is as sharp as ever (which is saying a lot), though not much of a drinker.Judging by the many comments Hitch made in his conversation (Luce wondered how he could eat at all, given how much talking he did), so far, so good for him, too. Hitch covers a lot of ground, from what triggered his exit from the left to the Clintons and his ethnic identity as a new American. This is a great read.Hat tip: Real Clear Politics","at0801200_1.text","Conservative",12,"at"
"81","What are the top 10 existential risks to humanity? (HT: Instapundit)It's a good thing someone is thinking about some of these things because frankly, the end of humanity is something I care not to contemplate much.But on the other hand, some very smart people have been contemplating some of the weirdest, most bizarre means by which the human race will cease to exist. And that makes for some of the most fascinating science reading I've done in years.Consider some of the scenarios.1, Biological:No intelligence agency, no matter how astute, and no military, no matter how powerful and dedicated, can assure that a small terrorist group using readily available equipment in a small and apparently innocuous setting cannot mount a first-order biological attack. With the rapid advancements in technology, we are rapidly moving from having to worry about state-based biological programs to smaller terrorist-based biological programs. It's possible today to synthesize virulent pathogens from scratch, or to engineer and manufacture prions that, introduced undetectably over time into a nation's food supply, would after a long delay afflict millions with a terrible and often fatal disease. It's a new world.Yes it is. And please keep your end of the world scenarios to yourself, thank you.3. ExtraterrestrialAs any alien race able to reach us is likely to be considerably more advanced than us, we would do well to develop a communications and diplomatic protocol to minimize any frictions caused by a first contact situation, be it friendly, unfriendly or neutral. In particular, we would discourage actions which could all too easily be misinterpreted as overtly hostile such as preemptively scrambling — let alone launching — nuclear weapons during a possible first contact. The rule when engaging in contact with an alien race is to do anything possible to avoid war since we are quite likely to lose. This program will be devoted to developing the first contact protocol. In addition to this protocol, we should be careful about any devices that we are told to construct via alien messages, as such devices could be unfriendly AI or other harmful devices. If such a danger is suspected, this warning must be immediately made public knowledge to discourage others from activating possible alien weapons. Finally, we are against any efforts to on purposely provide our technological level and location to potentially hostile aliens. In other words, don't piss off the aliens and try to keep a low galactic profile.Finally, the most bizarre and most fascinating threat of all; the idea that we are all living in a computer similuation a la The Matrix and that we should never, under any circumstances, shut it down:It starts with the assumption that future civilisations will have enough computing power and programming skills to be able to create what I call “ancestor simulations”. These would be detailed simulations of the simulators’ predecessors – detailed enough for the simulated minds to be conscious and have the same kinds of experiences we have. Think of an ancestor simulation as a very realistic virtual reality environment, but one where the brains inhabiting the world are themselves part of the simulation. The simulation argument makes no assumption about how long it will take to develop this capacity. Some futurologists think it will happen within the next 50 years. But even if it takes10 million years, it makes no difference to the argument. Let me state what the conclusion of the argument is. The conclusion is that at least one of the following three propositions must be true: 1 Almost all civilisations at our level of development become extinct before becoming technologically mature. 2 The fraction of technologically mature civilisations that are interested in creating ancestor simulations is almost zero. 3 You are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.Obviously, brilliant people with entirely too much time on their hands.If you like science fiction turned science fact, read the whole thing.

"82","Speaking of left wing charges of American guilt over World War II, the well-known accusation that George W. Bush's family were somehow financing the rise of the Nazis in Germany is dealt with by Jonah Goldberg in his wonderful new bestseller Liberal Fascism. In the notes to Chapter Eight (Liberal Fascist Economics), on page 452, Goldberg states:""As for the charge that George W. Bush's grandfather was a Nazi collaborator of some sort, put forward in Phillip's book ""American Dynasty,"" Peter Schweizer demonstrates why this is such a bad-faith slander:One of Phillip's most attention-grabbing chapters posits the theory that the Bushes were involved in the rise of Adolf Hitler. While he correctly notes that Brown Brothers Harriman, an investment-banking firm employing Prescott Bush and George H. Walker (George W. Bush's great-grandfather), investing in Nazi-era German companies, Phillips fails to note that it was Averell Harriman, later FDR's ambassador to Moscow and Truman's commerce secretary, who initiated these investments (and some in Soviet Russia) before either of the Bushes joined the firm. Prescott Bush did not oversee these investments: the reality is that he was involved almost exclusively in managing the firm's domestic portfolio. It was Harriman who largely managed the foreign investments and, accordingly, it was he who met German and Soviet leaders.

"83","President Bush toured Israel's Yad Vashem memorial to the Holocaust yesterday and made an emotional remark that the US should have bombed Auschwitz. Maybe so, but if guilt is to be assigned, how about the USSR?Speaking as someone whose mother survived Auschwitz (she worked at an aircraft parts subcontractor there) and whose grandfather did not, I say the following. I am, in general, a lot more concerned about Iran's president Amadinejad's attempt to create the next Auschwitz than about some political platitudes about the last one now. But I will play armchair general here for a bit and discuss all the parties involved.  There have been many conflicting arguments about why there were no concerted efforts by the Allies to bomb Auschwitz. The distances were too great, some say, or the inadvertent killing of inmates would have been a impermissible battle cost, one that few US airmen wanted on their conscience. There was, in fact, one US air raid that did attempt to bomb the military target factories adjacent to Auschwitz (it hit some Nazi military housing), but a repeated bombing campaign would have probably been required to destroy the factories (of I.G. Farben and Buna Rubber, amongst others) and crematoria. All authors and casual commentators I've heard -- even Ed Asner, on some public television show many years ago -- chose to put blame on the West alone for not destroying Auschwitz. But the headquarters of the international socialist world at that time, the USSR, has been given a free pass from media analysis and criticism on this subject, even though they had air bases a mere one hundred miles or so from that death camp.In Donald Miller's great book  Masters of the Air: America's Bomber Boys Who Fought The Air War Against Nazi Germany, there is a detailed analysis of the US and Britain's considerations involving plans to bomb Auschwitz in 1944. On page 323, it discusses the distances involved, the proximity of Soviet air bases to the east of Auschwitz it states:""The Eighth Air Force could conceivably have carried out the mission from newly operational bases within easy range of Auschwitz. That June it had begun to fly ""shuttle missions"" to the Soviet Union, under the code name Frantic. Leaving from England, bombers hit targets deep inside the Reich and, instead of returning home, proceeded to airfields provided by Stalin near Kiev, in the Ukraine. From there they were able to strike targets in Eastern Europe and fly south to Italy and then, after rest and refueling, back to England, conducting bombing operations on every leg of the journey. But Stalin had tight control over what the Fortresses on Operation Frantic bombed, and he made sure that they concentrated on targets that directly aided the Red Army's summer offensive.""Joseph Stalin was no friend of the Jews, as has been well documented in many places. And it is reasonable to assume he would not have helped the US in attempts to bomb the death camp. Stalin would also have no control over what targets the US bombed. The Soviet Premier would not have wanted to lose the opportunity to grab some modern (at that time) German factories for his own use. He would want, I suspect, to either disassemble them for reconstruction in Russia or operate them in place under a postwar Soviet-controlled Polish government. But I can say, without speculating, that Stalin did not send any bombers to destroy the killing machine at Auschwitz himself, even though the distance was less than 200 kilometers, one way.On page 326, author Donald Miller discusses Stalin's October 1944 refusal to allow his air bases to be used as a landing area for US bombers flying in support of the Polish rebellion against the Nazis in Warsaw:""Roosevelt ordered another Frantic airlift, but on October 2, Stalin withdrew permission for Americans to use Frantic bases to support a rebellion he considered dangerous to his own interests, an uprising led by anit-communist forces tied to the Polish government-in-exile in London. A few days later, the Polish rebellion was crushed.""Had Stalin allowed the air bases to be used in support of Polish rebellion, partisans, as part of a general Polish uprising, might well have reached Auschwitz and even liberated it. This history recalled by President Bush this Friday in Israel is also very similar to the apologies for slavery that are often discussed in America. No apologies are demanded from the descendants of the Arab slave traders of Africa, just the current governments of the West. Third World ""people of color"" and Second World ""people of socialism"" never have to say they're sorry, in the liberal worldview. In either case, these one-sided apologies do not serve any of us well going into the Twenty-first Century. They are a band-aid for myopia, blocking our current vision - and a sop to political correctness.(Jack Kemp is not the politician of the same name.)","at0801200_4.text","Conservative",12,"at"
"84","Two new reports on last month's asssassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto have only added to the mystery and confusion surrounding that event:Two new reports on the assassination last month of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto suggest that the killing may have been an ambitious plot rather than an isolated act of violence and that the government of President Pervez Musharraf knows far more than it's admitted about the murder. A police officer who witnessed the assassination said that a mysterious crowd stopped Bhutto's car that day, moving her to emerge through the sunroof. And a document has surfaced in the Pakistani news media that contradicts the government's version of her death and contains details on the pistol and the suicide bomb used in the murder. The witness was Ishtiaq Hussain Shah of the Rawalpindi police. As Bhutto's car headed onto Rawalpindi's Liaquat Road after an election rally Dec. 27, a crowd appeared from nowhere and stopped the motorcade, shouting slogans of her Pakistan Peoples Party and waving party banners, according to his account. Bhutto, apparently thinking she was greeting her supporters, emerged through the sunroof of the bulletproof car to wave.Such a diversion as well as ""baiting the trap"" smells of a professional military operation. At the very least, there is a level of sophistication that might even be beyond al-Qaeda although perhaps we should never underestimate their capacity to do anything. Musharraf is a fool if he is trying to hide anything relating to the assassination. For whatever reason, it makes no sense simply because when information that he is sitting on comes out, it only feeds the suspicions against him and his government. This contributes to unrest in the streets which in turn, threatens his hold on power. It's a long way to February 18 and the elections.","at0801200_5.text","Conservative",12,"at"
"85","A measure designed to allow thousands of Sunni Muslims who served under Saddam Hussein to regain their employment in the Iraqi government has passed the parliament today:Iraq's parliament adopted legislation Saturday on the reinstatement of thousands of former supporters of Saddam Hussein's Baath party to government jobs, a key benchmark sought by the United States as a step toward easing sectarian tensions. The bill was approved by a unanimous show of hands on each of the law's 30 clauses. Titled the Accountability and Justice law, it seeks to relax restrictions on the rights of members of the now-dissolved Baath party to fill government posts. It is also designed to reinstate thousands of Baathists dismissed from government jobs after the 2003 U.S. invasion — a decision that deepened sectarian tensions between Iraq's majority Shiites and the once-dominant Sunni Arabs, who believed the firings targeted their community.Without a doubt, this is the most significant political development in Iraq since the invasion. It was always first on the list of demands made by Sunnis before any kind of reconciliation would be talked about. And the American government had been pushing the measure for years. The holdup had always been a lack of trust by Shias that Sunnis wouldn't try to take over the government as well as a belief that those Baathists guilty of war crimes or crimes against Iraqis should not be rewarded. The measure addresses those concerns: The draft law approved Saturday is not a blanket approval for all former Baathists to take government jobs. The law will allow low-ranking Baathists not involved in past crimes against Iraqis to go back to their jobs. High-ranking Baathists will be sent to compulsory retirement and those involved in crimes will stand trial, though their families will still have the right to pension. The Baathists who were members in Saddam's security agencies must retire — except for members of Fidayeen Saddam, a feared militia formed by Saddam's eldest son, Oday. They will be entitled to nothing.This is an extraordinary day in Iraq. And it is time for the Democrats to face up to the fact that it would never have occurred without the presence of American troops. If the nation had listened to them last year, there would be chaos in Iraq. Instead, there is hope - real, palpable hope - that all sides in Iraq can come to some kind of accommodation and live together in peace. It has come with a heavy price - for both America and Iraq. But today's vote has brought peace closer than at any time since American troops helped the Iraqis tear down the statue of the hated Saddam.","at0801200_6.text","Conservative",12,"at"
"86","John McCain has parlayed his big win in New Hampshire into a double digit lead in the Republican race for president.The senator from Arizona is the front-runner in the battle for the Republican presidential nomination, according to the first national poll taken after the New Hampshire primary. McCain has the support of 34 percent of registered Republicans in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey out Friday. That's a 21-point jump from the last CNN/Opinion Research poll, taken in December, well before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary earlier this month. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who won the Iowa Republican caucuses, is in second place in the new survey, with 21 percent of those registered Republicans polled supporting him for the GOP nomination. Rudy Giuliani follows with 18 percent, a drop of six points from the December poll, when the former New York City mayor was the front-runner. ""Only McCain gained support among Republicans nationally. McCain's now the clear Republican front-runner,"" said Bill Schneider, CNN senior political analyst.The spectacular rise of McCain is partly fueled by the fact that the other front runners in the race appear to be weakening. Mike Huckabee received no bounce whatsoever out of Iowa as he polled only 12% in New Hampshire. Both Mitt Romney and Rudy Giulliani have been sinking in the polls for weeks. McCain has also surged ahead in Florida and is closing in on Romney in Michigan. If McCain can manage to win in Michigan next Tuesday, the questions regarding his inevitability will begin in earnest and Republicans could coalesce behind the Arizona senator if only to avoid a bruising fight beyond the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries.","at0801200_7.text","Conservative",12,"at"
"87","Today the Wall Street Journal details the corruption in five World Bank projects in India which former bank President Wolfowitz suspended and which anti-corruption chief Folsom has exposed to the Bank Board, to the enmity of the Bank members and staff who want to continue business as usual.[N]othing we've seen so far can compare to what has now been uncovered about five health projects in India, involving $569 million in loans. The projects were the subject of a ""Detailed Implementation Review,"" a lengthy forensic examination undertaken by Ms. Folsom's Department of Institutional Integrity, known within the bank as INT. As of this writing the bank has not publicly released the review, though it's been shared with the bank's board. But we've seen a copy and are posting its executive summary on wsj.com/opinion and OpinionJournal.com (click here to see it). We are also posting photographs that show the real price that corruption in bank projects exacts on the poor. Here are some of the lowlights:In the $54 million ""Food and Drug Capacity Building Project,"" for which money is still being disbursed, the INT found ""questionable procurement practices, some of which indicate fraud and corruption, in contracts representing 87 percent of the number of pieces and 88 percent of the total value of equipment procured."" That is nearly $9 of every $10 in aid funds[snip]The report goes on in this vein for hundreds of pages. With the exception of Paul Volcker's investigation of the U.N. Oil for Food scandal, we can think of no comparable review of an international organization that has brought such damaging facts to light, certainly not one that was internally conducted.The Journal is right.

"88","For the last 10 days, crime scene investigators from Scotland Yard have been pouring over evidence in the death of Benazir Bhutto. Their conclusion: It was an al-Qaeda operation:BRITISH officials have revealed that evidence amassed by Scotland Yard detectives points towards Al-Qaeda militants being responsible for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. Five experts in video evidence and forensic science have been in Pakistan for 10 days since President Pervez Musharraf took up an offer from Gordon Brown for British help in the investigation of the December 27 killing. Last week they were joined by three specialists in explosives. As for who specifically was involved in the assassination, Scotland Yard concurred with the Musharraf government: “Linking Mehsud to Bhutto’s assassination was done for strategic reasons and had nothing to do with the ground realities,” said Sajjan Gohel, an expert on Al-Qaeda. “Although Mehsud has ideological sympathies with the Taliban, his influence does not extend beyond the tribal areas and he certainly does not have the resources to plan an attack in the centre of the country like the assassination of Bhutto.” But British and American officials, who have examined the transcript, say they believe it is genuine and share Musharraf’s view that Mehsud is behind most of the suicide bombings in Pakistan. Asked why Pakistani forces do not capture Mehsud, one official said: “It’s not so easy to go into tribal areas. Look what happened to the last lot of Pakistani soldiers that tried.” According to diplomats, Mehsud had dispatched teams of suicide bombers round the country to follow Bhutto to rallies and seize an opportunity to kill her. Fingerprints on the gun fired at Bhutto were traced to a man in Swat - the same area that Meshud operates. While Scotland Yard cannot discover how she died, it seems an accepted fact now even by the government that Bhutto was shot in the neck and killed before the suicide bomber could set off his device. Scotland Yard expects to wrap up its investigation prior to the February 18 elections.","at0801300_1.text","Conservative",13,"at"

The history will say, it was when you were called upon, you served, and the service you rendered was absolutely necessary to defeat an enemy overseas so we do not have to face them here at home. (Applause.) It will say loud and clear that this military, comprised of brave men and women who sacrificed on behalf of a noble cause called peace -- the men and women of this military understood that we're in an ideological struggle; that we're facing cold-blooded murderers who kill the innocent to achieve their hateful vision of a future. And they understood, history will show, that those who wore the uniform in the beginning of the 21st century understood a timeless truth that the ideology of -- based upon liberty is necessary for peace; that in this ideological struggle, on the short-term, we will find and bring the enemies to justice, but in the long term, the best way to defeat the ideology of hate is one with an ideology of hope, and that's one with liberty at its fundamental core. (Applause.) The president received a boisterous welcome from the troops and he highlighted his determination to start drawing down our forces in Iraq as the situation permits: President Bush said Saturday that the United States was on track to bring home at least 20,000 troops from Iraq by summer, but he emphasized that he was willing to halt the drawdown ""in order to make sure we succeed."" After meeting in Kuwait with his top commander in Iraq, Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, and the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, the president presented a mixed picture of the conditions one year after he called for sending additional troops to Iraq. Bush said that extremist militias had been disrupted but remained a concern. ""We cannot take the achievements of 2007 for granted,"" he said, referring to the reduction in violence toward the end of 2007, after the deadlier months at the start of the year. With a stop at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, the president was as close to Iraq as he is likely to get on his eight-day trip through the Middle East and Persian Gulf, unless he makes a detour to the war zone. The supply base is about 100 miles from Iraq.Bush is also on the verge of beginning negotiations with the Iraqi government over a permanent security arrangement. Democrats have been urging Bush not to start such negotiations. They don't want Bush to tie the hands of a Democratic president if such a thing were to come to pass.But Bush is determined to push ahead with such an agreement that will guarantee an American presence in Iraq long after most of our combat troops are gone.","at0801300_2.text","Conservative",13,"at"
"90","With the economy taking center stage in Michigan, a new Detroit Free Press poll shows Mitt Romney narrowly in front of John McCain 27%-22% with Mike Huckabee in third with 16%. Republican primary voters whose greatest concern is the economy could give Bloomfield Hills native Mitt Romney his first major state victory in Tuesday’s Michigan presidential primary, according to the Detroit Free Press-Local 4 Michigan Poll. Romney leads John McCain, 27%-22%, with Mike Huckabee in third at 16%, the poll showed. Romney’s core of support is in metro Detroit, where he has a 2-1 advantage. Of the 40% who named the economy as their top concern, Romney had a 42%-25% advantage over McCain. McCain wins by about the same margin over Romney among the 24% of Republican voters whose top issue is the Iraq war. But Romney's lead could evaporate, depending on how tentative, undecided and uncommitted voters lean over the next two days. About 38% of voters who had a favorite said they might change their mind by Tuesday. Another 22% hadn't picked a candidate. The poll also shows that relatively few Democratic voters plan to vote in the Republican primary, a factor that may be difficult to gauge. Independents and Democrats who cross over to the GOP could tip the election to McCain if they show up in substantial numbers.The Romney name still has some magic in Michigan. That coupled with Romney's perceived strength in dealing with the economy has somewhat negated the huge bounce McCain got from winning New Hampshire. It will likely keep Romney competitive in the state to the end. Can Huckabee pull off a miracle and finish second? Some analysts believe that if Huckabee can duplicate his Iowa ground game where he utilized his network of evangelical churches to get out his vote that he may surprise in Michigan. If so, a third place for McCain or Romney would be devastating to either man's candidacy.It looks like it will come down to the wire with the result dependent on just how many independents and Democrats John McCain can pull into the voting booths on Tuesday.","at0801300_3.text","Conservative",13,"at"
"91","Counting civilian deaths in Iraq is a ghoulish business. Given the chaos in the country for much of the last 4 years and the breakdown of government record keeping, the job has devolved into a statistical morass where competing methodologies give entirely different totals.At the center of the controversy have been two separate studies done by researchers at Johns Hopkins University that were published in the respected British medical journal, The Lancet. The results from both studies were wildly at odds with other estimates and resulted in questions being raised about the methodology used to determine the findings.Now we have evidence that there may indeed have been political motivations in doing the study and in reaching its controversial conclusions.Half of the funding for the study came from the George Soros group the Open Society Institute:The study, published in 2006, was hailed by antiwar campaigners as evidence of the scale of the disaster caused by the invasion, but Downing Street and President George Bush challenged its methodology. New research published by The New England Journal of Medicine estimates that 151,000 people – less than a quarter of The Lancet estimate – have died since the invasion in 2003. “The authors should have disclosed the [Soros] donation and for many people that would have been a disqualifying factor in terms of publishing the research,” said Michael Spagat, economics professor at Royal Holloway, University of London. The Lancet study was commissioned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and led by Les Roberts, an associate professor and epidemiologist at Columbia University. He reportedly opposed the war from the outset.An anti-war researcher receiving funds from an anti-war, anti-American billionaire? And the highly respected Lancet publishing the findings anyway? The question of motivations for doing the study in the first place have been revealed to be not in the interest of science but politics. The editor of the Lancet should be fired for besmirching the reputation of that journal and Professor Roberts should also suffer some kind of penalty for dragging the good name of Columbia University down into a political cesspool. But neither will happen. Leftist academics are well protected and the political motivations of the editor of the Lancet will be obscured by weasel words denying any political angle to publishing the study. And George Soros will continue his anti-American activities unencumbered by any principles or morals. At my blog, I have more on Soros as well as a review of the timing of the Lancet studies.","at0801300_4.text","Conservative",13,"at"
"92","Dear Editor:The January 12 article in American Thinker by Abdirahman Warsame entitled ""Problems in the VOA-Somali Service"" contained a number of inaccuracies and false statements, to which the Voice of America offers the following response.First, some background: VOA's Somali Service went on the air in February 2007. It now broadcasts three hours a day of news, information and features that can be heard in Somalia in the late afternoon and early evening on shortwave and FM radio. The program's mandate has been to provide the unbiased, accurate, credible information called for by the VOA Charter, and the overwhelmingly positive response from Somali listeners indicates that they value those qualities in our programs. In his article, Mr. Warsame said that several of our broadcasters are ""well known hardcore supporters"" of the Islamic Courts. There is no truth to this statement. The similar accusation that VOA freelance reporters in Somalia are opposed to the Transitional Federal Government is equally false.  VOA's Charter requires us to present balanced and fair programming that seeks out all responsible points of view on controversial issues of public importance.  To fulfill this mandate, VOA's Somali Service has interviewed the full range of political leaders and personalities, including those from the Transitional Federal Government, the Union of Islamic Courts, and other relevant political groups.  It has presented the views of a wide range of ordinary Somali citizens as well, opening a broadcast space for the public discussion of Somalia's future. Responsibility for preparing these interviews rotates among the staff, and our editors insure that the interviews in no way reflect the personal convictions of the journalists who conduct them. VOA's Somali Service does not, as alleged, broadcast ""unbalanced, selective, and exaggerated field-reports."" While statistics may change in this ongoing conflict, the details of conflict in Mogadishu reported by the VOA Somali Service are very consistent with figures used by other major news operations and are the same figures used by the VOA Central newsroom.Mr. Warsame is incorrect is stating that the Somali Service's coverage is dominated by events in Mogadishu. VOA coverage is dominated by the major news of the day from throughout Somalia. VOA uses nearly two dozen reporters in Somalia and the region. News is supplemented by reporting on education, health, youth, Diaspora affairs, music and sports. There are also discussion programs, call-in shows and special features, such as profiles of ordinary citizens who are making a positive difference in their communities.Mr. Warsame has cited an error in translation of an English idiomatic expression in an interview with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer in 2007. The error in translation occurred, but his assertion that ""the interview was totally mistranslated"" is false. In the best traditions of journalism, the error in translation was quickly discovered and acknowledged on the VOA Somali Website; the entire English transcript of Ms. Frazer's interview was posted on the Website as well as the correction with an apology was broadcast as soon as possible after the error was recognized. VOA believes that an important part of credibility is recognizing errors when they occur, and correcting them quickly.  In this case, officials of the Somali Transitional Federal Government thanked VOA for its quick action on the matter.It is true, as Mr. Warsame points out, that TFG officials from time to time disagree with something we broadcast. When that happens, we put these officials on the air to set the record straight as they see it.Mr. Warsame also injects the worst aspects of Somali clan politics into his critique with the false assertion that all members of the Service come from a single clan. Staff of the Somali service are chosen, not for their ethnic identity, but for their journalistic experience and abilities, as reflected in their ability to pass a written test, a voice test and to demonstrate the necessary professional experience.VOA welcomes constructive criticism of its programs and we particularly value the input of Somali-Americans who are concerned about the future of their former homeland. The VOA Somali Service's three hours of daily broadcasting are by design filled with the diverse opinions of Somalis from all walks of life, just as the U.S. media is filled with the multiplicity of voices of Americans. We hope our broadcasts give our listeners a safe place to express their views and to weigh their decisions about Somalia's future.Sincerely,Letitia M.

"93","It will probably come down to turnout in the Michigan Republican primary tomorrow. With all the polls showing a near dead heat between John McCain and Mitt Romney, the contest will be decided by who goes to the polls.For Romney who has demonstrated strength in urban areas like Detroit and Grand Rapids, getting his supporters to the polls will be absolutely key. During the first nine days of January, the Romney campaign spent more than $2 million in advertisements on television and radio in Michigan. Compare that with McCain's $359,000 and Huckabee's $39,000. On top of that, Romney's campaign recently announced it was pulling its paid media in other early-voting states and focusing its remaining resources in Michigan. Still, Romney says the state is ""not do-or die..."" Romney and his rivals are all trying to convince Michigan voters that they can ease the state's economic concerns. The state's unemployment rate sits a 7.4 percent. As for McCain, he must turn out as many independent and conservative Democratic voters as he can to vote for him. Michigan allows for such cross over voting as did New Hampshire, a state McCain won rather handily. Romney has pounced on a couple of missteps by McCain, criticizing his rival for saying that some jobs will never come back to Michigan while McCain has been touting his record on Iraq - an issue that is bound to play well in a state where polls show that the war is the number 2 concern among state Republicans. Can Romney stop the McCain ""Straight Talk Express"" dead in its tracks? He is going to have to if he wishes to continue as a viable candidate. Romney was born in Michigan and his father was governor there. A loss would raise the question ""If he can't win in Michigan, where can he win?"" A win by McCain on the other hand would propel him into Saturday's South Carolina primary with a lot of momentum. And a win there along with a win in Florida could very well make him the prohibitive favorite to capture the nomination. It will probably be a late night in Michigan before the results are known.","at0801400_1.text","Conservative",14,"at"

And using it as a weapon in a campaign went out with George Wallace.But you had to know that if there were a way to raise the issue and get people thinking about it, the Clintons would find a way. Hence, the last 48 hours have seen several elliptical references to race by Clinton surrogates as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton themselves which serve the purpose of reminding people just who it is that opposes Hillary - and what color he is:Clinton, on defense over comments that she and her husband made regarding Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy and Obama's fitness for the White House, tried to turn the tables on her top primary rival. She accused his campaign of looking to score political points by distorting their words. Hillary Clinton had said King's dream of racial equality was realized only when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, while Bill Clinton said Illinois Sen. Obama was telling a ""fairy tale"" about his opposition to the Iraq war. Black leaders have criticized their comments, and Obama said Sunday her comment about King was ""ill-advised."" ""I think it offended some folks who felt that somehow diminished King's role in bringing about the Civil Rights Act,"" he told reporters on a conference call. ""She is free to explain that, but the notion that somehow this is our doing is ludicrous.""In addition, Bob Johnson, the founder of the Black Entertainment Network, introduced Hillary at a campaign rally by savaging Obama, even alluding to his drug use. The Obama campaign called foul but the Clintons pleaded innocent saying they had no control over what Johnson had to say. Then a memo surfaced from the Obama campaign detailing what the staffer believed were ""racially insensitive"" comments from the Clinton camp. This made it appear as if the Obama camp was also going to play the race card at some point, using the statements as ammunition: As evidence the Obama campaign had pushed the story, Clinton advisers pointed to a memo written by an Obama staffer compiling examples of comments by Clinton and her surrogates that could be construed as racially insensitive. The memo later surfaced on some political Web sites. ""This is an unfortunate story line the Obama campaign has pushed very successfully,"" the former first lady said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I don't think this campaign is about gender, and I sure hope it's not about race."" Clinton taped the show before appearances in South Carolina, where at least half the primary voters are expected to be black. On Monday, she planned to attend a union event honoring King's legacy in New York City.And so it goes. The Clinton camp not overtly but subtly, bringing race into the mix. And Obama, realizing the dynamite involved, responding cautiously but directly to the challenge.It is a tightrope both candidates will walk until one of them emerges victorious from the primaries.","at0801400_2.text","Conservative",14,"at"
"95","As the debate builds about state-controlled thermostats in your homes, you may notice that programmable communicating thermostats (PCTs) are now being referred to as ""Smart"" thermostats.  This conflates PCTs with programmable, or ""setback"" thermostats which have been around for decades and are totally under the householder's control with no radio override features.  Google ""smart thermostat"" and you'll find information on both kinds.In fact, there has never been any intelligence built into either design.  Were PCTs  to be domineering robots with artificial intelligence?  Were they to be smarter than you?  Perhaps we should be thankful PCTs don't have arms and legs and run around your house turning off the lights.  We have mandatory, permanent motion sensors for that job, at least in commercial buildings.The controversy is that PCTs are dumb machines that will blindly, automatically, follow commands sent by central power authorities and not those of the head of the household.  The will, volition, and responsibility reside in the humans who manage the electrical grid.At best, this shift in terms reflects muddled thinking and loose use of the English language.  Like anyone who is trying to sell you something, people who would apply the term ""smart"" to a dumb machine are engaging in puffery and shifting accountability.The term ""smart"" has been applied since at least 2002 in planning documents but it is nowhere to be found in the Title 24 regulations, to the CEC's credit.Another propaganda technique used by advocates of government-controlled thermostats is the creation of a false dichotomy, stating the issue as a choice only between government rationing via PCTs and blackouts.   The real choice is between government-managed shortages and adequate supplies of electricity.  Investors are ready, willing, and able to build new generation for the citizens of the state of California.  Just ask Warren Buffett about his Idaho nuke project or Tom Hutson with his plans in Fresno.  If the state can not better manage to serve our electrical needs, perhaps we should ask them to just step aside and let buyers and sellers make our own deals.This bears close watching.","at0801400_3.text","Conservative",14,"at"
"96","An al-Qaeda terrorist plot against the Queen of England was foiled last year at the Commonwealth Summit in Uganda, according to the Ugandan government:AL Qaeda terrorists posing as TV crews planned to blow up the Queen by smuggling explosives into last year’s Commonwealth summit. Two huge outside broadcast vans belonging to the Uganda Broadcasting Corporation were seized after a tip-off from intelligence agents. As a result, UBC was unable to transmit live pictures of key summit events, including the Queen’s historic address to the Ugandan parliament on November 22. Dr Ruhakana Rugunda, the Uganda Minister of Internal Affairs, said: “We received information that a terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda, the Allied Democratic Forces, was planning to carry out terrorist activities at the Commonwealth meeting. The security services in Uganda neutralised these threats.” The ADF is a radical Muslim group operating in western Uganda and has largely been neutralized by the Ugandan government. But they still claim some strongholds and have received assistance from al-Qaeda in the past. While the threat doesn't sound that serious, who knows? It didn't seem feasible that a couple of terrorists could hijack airplanes and fly them into buildings either. We dismiss these plots at our own peril.","at0801400_4.text","Conservative",14,"at"
"97","This is a story that could only happen as a result of the internet.It is  the world wide web that has fueled the candidacy of Ron Paul from the beginning, gathering not only the rational libertarians, paleoconservatives, and anti-war Democrats to his cause but also the dark underbelly of humanity who apparently have so much time on their hands that they can harrass, threaten, and scare the living daylights out of a small town New Hampshire clerk who made an honest error on the primary voting sheet she sent to the Secretary of State in New Hampshire.The unhinged nature of some Ron Paul supporters has been well documented. But someone should probably be arrested for this kind of behavior:Jennifer Call's eyes searched the office for nothing in particular. Her arms waved and her fear spilled out. ""This is where I grew up,"" Sutton's town clerk said yesterday. ""This is my hometown, this is where my family is, and all of sudden, my name is being splashed across the internet as this horrible person. And the frightening part is, I don't know these people and they don't know me."" Call wants the nationwide army of boisterous Ron Paul supporters, believers in more conspiracy theories than Oliver Stone, to know that she's committed no crime. Not treason, as the dozens of phone callers screamed. Not fraud, as the dozens of e-mails charged. Nothing. Human error, by someone unknown, caused Call's office to claim Paul received zero votes from the town during Tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary. Paul actually got a whopping 31 votes. Out of 920 cast. Launch an investigation. Alert the media. The mistake was corrected early the next morning, but that hardly mattered. The Paul machine, upon reading the number in print, quickly went into counteroffensive mode. What happened next is unbelievable. The aroused Paulbots began calling Mrs. Call at the office, at her home. They sent her dozens of emails - some of them threatening. She was forced to get an unlisted number. She actually began to fear for her safety. The calls kept coming. Some ""national radio host"" had given out her number and told his listeners to call her demanding ""answers."" Of course, the answer was simple human error. But once the crazies were loosed, no explanation could stop them: She got about five more the next day in her office. She tried to get work done. She called the Massachusetts company that makes the licenses for dog owners in her area. The guy had heard of her. ""Wow,"" the man said. ""This is the second time this week I've seen your name."" ""Where?"" Call asked. ""I've gotten a dozen e-mails about how you've destroyed the New Hampshire primary."" ""Why?"" ""We make voting machines."" ""The problem is,"" Call said yesterday, ""we don't use voting machines."" She went home and locked her doors. She called her mother in North Carolina. She cried. The calls kept coming. She unhooked her answering machine and requested an unlisted number. ""I was drained emotionally and physically,"" Call said. ""That's when I really started to freak out. Thursday it hit me, that most of these people are not rational. That's when I became scared."" Ron Paul will never be elected president. But his supporters win the prize for being the most doltish, unhinged, discourteous, and mentally unbalanced in the race.","at0801400_5.text","Conservative",14,"at"
"98","No one denies that Mike Huckabee, the former Baptist Preacher, is a great communicator on the stump. His down home demeanor and wit have rocketed him into second place in most national polls.But Huckabee is not running for Preacher in Chief. He is running for President of the United States. And what becomes apparent when scratching the surface of his candidacy is that he really hasn't thought very much about what kinds of policies he would seek to enact as president:Huckabee needed to come up with an immigration plan in a hurry last month. He was beginning his remarkable ascent in opinion polls, but was under attack from GOP rivals for a ""liberal"" position on immigration while governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. His record in Arkansas, supporting tuition breaks for illegal immigrants and opposing a federal roundup of undocumented workers, made him vulnerable to criticism from the right. When the campaign announced the governor's nine-point immigration plan on Dec. 6, it noted that it was ""partially modeled"" on Krikorian's proposal three years earlier. But Huckabee took credit for the plan in the Republican debate on Thursday night, and Mitt Romney's campaign is crying foul. A Romney ""Fact Check"" said that the Huckabee plan had lifted ""whole sections of Krikorian's editorial without quotes or direct attribution."" A point-by-point comparison of the two plans supports the Romney critique. Huckabee's is virtually identical to Krikorian's, with the exception of two points: Build the Fence and Establish an Economic Border. Huckabee says that his proposal for a flat-rate sales tax, known as the ""fair tax,"" would create an ""economic disincentive"" for illegal immigration, by forcing undocumented workers to pay taxes. If Huckabee were a student, he would stand convicted of plagiarism. But beyond the sneaking dishonesty is the stark fact that here is a man who is either too lazy or just not interested in what kinds of policies he would pursue if he were elected. His history as Arkansas governor would tend toward the former as there were criticisms of the governor being unprepared for staff meetings at times as well as being put on the spot by reporters in press conferences.Platitudes and bible quoting only get you so far in a campaign. There comes a time when a candidate must demonstrate a surehandedness when advocating their policy prescriptions for the country. So far, Huckabee has gotten away with spouting generalities - largely because his policies are not very conservative. The question becomes when will the veil fall from the eyes of voters and reveal this man to be the shallow, unprepared candidate that he truly is.","at0801400_6.text","Conservative",14,"at"
"99","In the midst of his 6 country, eight day Middle East trip, President Bush urged Middle Eastern countries to reject the extremism represented by Iran and al-Qaeda and embrace democracy.Speaking to a gathering in the United Arab Emirites, the President called on the region's nation's to unite against Iran:Mr. Bush, speaking yesterday inside the $3 billion Emirates Palace Hotel to an audience of a few hundred, said regional hopes of peace and prosperity are threatened by ""violent extremists who murder the innocent in pursuit of power."" Iran, he said, is ""the world's leading state sponsor of terror,"" and its actions, especially its defiance of United Nations resolutions against its nuclear-weapons program, ""threaten the security of nations everywhere."" ""So the United States is strengthening our long-standing security commitments with our friends in the Gulf, and rallying friends around the world to confront this danger before it is too late,"" Mr. Bush said. Mr. Bush's coalition-building swing through six Middle East countries is being buttressed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy's concurrent three-country trip to the region.President Sarkozy is in the region trying to bolster French commercial ties with Arab countries. Not coincidentally, he is holding out the carrot of civilian nuclear technology in order to get cooperation on confronting Iran. To put some steel into his words, the White House announced that the US government will offer Saudi Arabia a massive 3 year $30 billion military aid package that includes some of our most sophisticated weapons and munitions. This is the same package offered by the president last year that was withdrawn after strenuous protests from Israel. Since then, we have agreed to sell Israel even more advanced weaponry so it is assumed that the Saudi deal now has a green light.","at0801400_7.text","Conservative",14,"at"
"100","The Heritage Foundation just released its latest Index of Economic Freedom.  It provides ever more evidence that economic freedom yields ""greater prosperity for the larger society.""  It also helps bolster the point I made just last weekend that the New York Times' star op-ed columnist (and Princeton University professor) Paul Krugman gets it exactly backward regarding Europe, the ""Comeback Continent.""  The study itself makes clear that the economic theories of Adam Smith still hold.""Economic theory dating back to the publication of Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations in 1776 emphasizes the lesson that basic institutions that protect the liberty of individuals to pursue their own economic interests result in greater prosperity for the larger society...  The world's freest countries have twice the average per capita income of the second quintile of countries and over five times the average income of the fifth quintile.  The freest economies also have lower rates of unemployment and lower inflation.""Regarding Europe, its success is due not to its big government ways, but to cuts in government, resulting largely from internal competition.""Europe has continued to advance its economic freedom because of policy improvements, such as tax cuts and other business climate reforms, adopted by many of the region's individual economies as they compete with one another to attract more investment.""According to Cassie Biggs at the Associated Press, the study authors attribute the recent success of ""old Europe"" countries to the competition from the lower, flatter tax countries of new Europe that have recently shed communism and embraced economic freedom. ""What we are seeing is a very strong commitment to economic freedom in the new EU countries, and this is having a positive impact on policies in the some of the older European countries ... such as France,"" said Edwin Feulner, president of the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. ""I think we will continue to see this evolve over time and we expect to see gradual improvement in economic freedom throughout Europe as a whole.""I had mentioned Ireland in particular.  Among developed countries it had cut government spending the most in the last two decades, and in fact reduced government spending to a smaller fraction of its economy than even that of the U.S..  The Heritage Foundation now ranks Ireland 3rd in economic freedom, higher than the U.S. in 5th place.Why is this obvious connection between freedom and prosperity, theorized and demonstrated for over 200 years, such a difficult sell?  The Heritage Foundation takes a shot at the answer.""Perhaps the idea of freedom is too sophisticated, as popular support for it seems constantly to erode before the onslaught of populism.""Paul Krugman, the Democratic party and even some in the Republican party are not helping matters.By the way, Heritage's top five are Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland, Australia and the United States.  The bottom five are North Korea, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Libya and Burma .","at0801500_0.text","Conservative",15,"at"
